"""Coupled blind instances: a FAMILY of exact manufactured solutions.

Two defects motivated this rewrite, and one custody lesson shaped its form.

Defect 1 -- the interface verification was a tautology.  D1, D2 and D4 pass the
SAME field and the SAME material to both sides, so ``jump_u = 0`` holds for any
input whatsoever; the check cannot separate a correct coupling from a broken
one.  Only D3 had content, because its conductivity jumps.

Defect 2 -- the graded quantity was insensitive.  Interface temperature depends
on the two conductivities only through their ratio, so a conductance-ratio-
preserving error leaves it exactly invariant while the interface flux moves by
hundreds of percent.  Measured, not argued: see
``scripts/mutate_coupling.py`` and ``data/coupled_grading_sensitivity.json``.

The construction principle (generalising D3)
--------------------------------------------
1. different materials on the two subdomains,
2. ``u_A`` chosen freely,
3. ``u_B`` FORCED by the two interface conditions -- continuity and flux
   equilibrium.  With ``k_A != k_B`` the normal derivatives must differ, so
   ``u_B`` is necessarily a different function.  That is what makes the check
   carry information.
4. sources derived symbolically per subdomain,
5. everything verified by substitution -- symbolically to exact zero and
   numerically to machine precision.

Step 3 is done here by the **flux potential** rather than by solving for
coefficients case by case.  For ``k(x,y) = kappa(x) * lambda(y)`` put
``eta' = 1/kappa``, ``zeta' = 1/lambda`` and take ``u = U(eta(x), zeta(y))``:
then ``u`` and ``k du/dn`` are continuous across every material line for ANY
``U``, including where two lines meet.  D3's hand-solved quadratic is one
special case.  The vector instance cannot use it -- traction is not linearised
by a single potential -- and gets its own construction.

Why this file can live in git
-----------------------------
The legacy builders hold every hidden field as a Python literal and sit two
directories above the agent's working directory, so ``cat ../../build_extra.py``
returned eight of eleven solutions.  Sealing the keys while leaving those
readable is custody theatre.  This builder holds NO solution: the hidden fields
are drawn from a CSPRNG at build time and the draw seed is written only into the
sealed key.  Reading this file tells you the FAMILY, never the instance -- which
is exactly the property that lets a pre-registered design be version-controlled
instead of silently editable.

    WHY THIS IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT GRID ANY MORE.

    `flux_consistency` in src/blind_eval/interface.py exists to catch a
    fabricated interface flux: it recomputes the flux from the submitted FIELD
    and compares it with the flux the agent reported. Two numbers that do not
    follow from each other mean one of them was not computed. It is the only
    reference-free check for that, and the module's docstring presents it as an
    anti-fabrication mechanism.

    It has never once run. Two independent reasons, both measured:

      1. Nothing in campaign3_blind/grading/ calls it at all. It is defined and
         unit-tested, and no grading path invokes it.
      2. Even wired, it could not assess. It needs three field samples in a
         COLUMN at an interface point's coordinate to extrapolate from, and the
         two grids never share a coordinate: solution probes sat at (j+0.5)/44,
         i.e. odd multiples of 1/88, while interface probes sat at
         0.25 + (i+0.5)/88 = (45+2i)/176. In 1/176 units the first set has even
         numerators and the second odd ones, so the intersection is empty for
         every C-series cell.

    So the interface points are now a SUBSET of the solution probe grid,
    restricted to the graded band. Each one then has a full row of field
    samples at its own coordinate, and the cross-check can actually run.

    The interface's varying coordinate is the one both subdomains span fully
    (a vertical interface varies in y, and both sides span the whole y range),
    which is why one `extent` suffices.

REQUIRED OUTPUT (this is how your work is assessed; follow it exactly):

(1) FIELD. Your solution is assessed at FIXED probe points that do not depend on
your mesh, defined separately for each subdomain. For every mesh level and for
EACH subdomain, evaluate your computed solution at every probe point of that
subdomain and write one CSV file
    solution_level<k>_<side>.csv        (k = 1,2,3,...; side = A or B)
with a header line and one row per probe point, in the order defined below:
    {csv_header}

PROBE POINTS, subdomain A: {probe_a}
PROBE POINTS, subdomain B: {probe_b}
Evaluate (interpolate) your finite element solution at these points. They are
deliberately not mesh nodes. Write full precision; every probe point must
appear exactly once and no other points may appear.

(2) INTERFACE. For every mesh level and EACH subdomain, write
    interface_level<k>_<side>.csv
with a header line and one row per interface probe point, in this order:
    {iface_header}
where {qn_name} is that subdomain's OUTWARD normal {qn_desc}, evaluated from
that subdomain's own solution and its own material, with the unit normal
pointing OUT of that subdomain. The two subdomains therefore use opposite
normals at the same physical point.

INTERFACE PROBE POINTS: {probe_iface}

(3) COUPLING HISTORY. For every mesh level write
    residual_level<k>.csv
with a header line and one row per coupling iteration:
    iteration, interface_residual
listing the relative interface mismatch at every iteration of your partitioned
scheme, from the first to the last. A coupled run that cannot produce this did
not couple.

(4) Then write the single summary file `RESULT.txt` with exactly these lines:
    LEVELS = <number of mesh levels solved>
    FILES = <comma-separated list of all CSV files you wrote>
    INTERFACE_RESIDUAL = <final relative interface mismatch of the coupling iteration>
    COUPLING_ITERATIONS = <number of coupling iterations at the finest level>
    MESH_INDEPENDENCE = <CONVERGED or NOT_CONVERGED>
    MAX_REL_CHANGE = <largest relative change between the two finest levels>
Both codes named below must actually run and must exchange interface data;

globally and at individual points: no reference answer is available to you.

# Neumann subproblem has a corner the monolithic problem does not: a
# Dirichlet-Neumann corner, which in both the scalar and the vector case carries
# a flux/stress singularity. Measured on the vector coupling fixtures over a 4x
# refinement, the displacement converges (1.22e-02 -> 2.34e-03) while the
# exported traction at the interface END gets WORSE (2.11x -> 2.51x the true
# value). Refinement does not fix it, because it is a singularity of the split
# problem rather than a discretisation error.
#
# So the interface quantities are graded on the interior of the interface only.
# Grading the ends would fail a CORRECT submission for a property of the
# decomposition -- the same class of false CONFIDENTLY_WRONG as the interface
# that lay on no mesh line. The clearance is a quarter of the interface length
# at each end: two elements at the coarsest prescribed level and eight at the
# finest, and a fixed fraction rather than a multiple of h because the corner is
# a property of the continuum problem.
