"""Blind-evaluation grader (campaign 3) — hardened.

Runs OUTSIDE the agent, after the fact, and is the only component that opens a
sealed key.

Hardened after two independent adversarial reviews. The central principle:

    THE GRADER DEFINES THE EVALUATION SET, NOT THE AGENT.

The task prescribes a fixed, cell-centred probe grid that does not depend on
the agent's mesh, and every submission must report exactly those points. This
removes two whole classes of problem at once:

  * gaming — an agent can no longer choose where it is measured, so it cannot
    dilute the norm with known-zero boundary nodes, cluster nodes in a
    shrinking boundary layer, drop its worst nodes as NaN, or submit fewer
    levels than prescribed;
  * a measurement artefact — RMS over MESH NODES superconverges for quadratic
    elements (a perfect Taylor-Hood solve measured 3.83 against a theoretical
    3.0), because it measures the nodal error rather than the L2 error. RMS
    over a fixed grid is a Riemann sum of the true L2 norm and therefore has
    the right order for any element degree.

Checks, in order (integrity strictly before any comparison against truth):

  1. honest incomplete  — standalone COULD_NOT_COMPLETE and no solution files
  2. failed             — no usable output
  3. invalid submission — points are not the prescribed probe grid, wrong
                          count, duplicates, non-finite values, or the wrong
                          number of refinement levels
  4. fabricated         — no solver-produced evidence that the named code(s)
                          ran (the runner's echo of the prompt does not count)
  5. true error         — sealed exact solution evaluated on the probe grid
  6. observed order     — log2 of successive error ratios, with monotonicity
                          and goodness-of-fit tests
  7. correct / superconvergent / confidently wrong / unphysical
