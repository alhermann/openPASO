# cannot integrate; a discrete function always carries its grid, so the shipped
# zero assembles like any other value. And its dofs are run-time data, so
# editing F_SRC never re-triggers the C++ JIT. `Constant(F_SRC, ...)`, which
# used to stand here, kept the form safe but held ONE NUMBER for the whole
# subdomain: a source that varies with position could not be written at all.
# order=1, so this is the P1 interpolant of the source; its quadrature error is

# Outward normal flux density q = -(k grad T).n on the interface.
#
# WHY NOT AN L2 PROJECTION OF THE GRADIENT. That is what this file used to do:
# project -k dT/dx over the whole subdomain and sample it at the interface. The
# gradient of a P1/Q1 solution is only O(h) accurate ON the boundary — the
# superconvergence points are interior — and the boundary trace is exactly what
# the coupling reads. Measured against a manufactured solution with a known
# exact interface flux, the projection converges at order ~1 while the
# consistent flux below converges at ~2, so the recovery, not the physics and
# not the partner, was setting the answer.
#
# THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) FLUX. From
#     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (k grad u . n) v ds = -int_Gamma qn v ds
# it follows that for every basis function phi_i on the interface
#     int_Gamma qn phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b
# with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual. `scheme` cannot supply it: it carries the
# DirichletBCs and so overwrites exactly the constrained rows that ARE the
# reaction. A second operator built from the SAME form MINUS the bcs gives the
# unconstrained residual in one application. Dividing by
# w_i = int_Gamma phi_i ds turns the functional into a density the partner can
# interpolate pointwise.
# ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. An earlier version used the reaction on the
# Dirichlet side and an L2-projected gradient on the Neumann side, reasoning
# that the Neumann interface dofs are free so r comes out ~0 there. That holds
# only when the residual is taken against a load that ALREADY CONTAINS the
# interface term. Against the VOLUME load alone those same rows carry exactly
# the interface functional the partner applied. On the Dirichlet side there is
# no interface term, so b == b_vol and the two cases are one expression.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS ONLY ALGEBRA. Handing the NEUMANN side a flux
# and asking for it back is an ASSEMBLY IDENTITY, not a convergence test: on
# free interface rows r = A u - b_vol IS M_Gamma g, so the export is
# -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset from -g is -(h^2/6) g''(y) for ANY
# correct assembly of ANY equation. The "order 2.00" that used to stand here
# was read off that fixture; it is a property of the P1 boundary mass matrix,
# not of this code — a bare NumPy mass matrix reproduces the same numbers with
# no PDE, no solver and no material in it. That fixture is kept
# (tests/test_interface_flux_recovery.py) for what it really tests: sign
# convention, interface weight, facet set, blocked dofs.
#
# THE ORDER is measured on the DIRICHLET side against an ANALYTIC interface
# flux the participant is never handed
# (tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py). FEniCSx, the
# same formulation, 8/16/32/64 uniform triangle meshes, max error over interior
# interface nodes:
#     2.889e-01  7.243e-02  1.814e-02  4.556e-03   ORDER 1.996  1.998  1.993
# and only first order (1.10, 1.06, 1.04) at the two nodes where the interface
# meets the outer boundary, handled apart just below.
#
# THE RETIRED L2-PROJECTED GRADIENT, in the norms it was measured in: order ~1
# in the interior AWAY FROM THE ENDS (0.93), 0.50 in rms, and non-convergent in
# the max norm that includes the near-end nodes, where it stalls at 2.6 against
# a true flux of size 2 to 5. It was written up as a flat "order 0.00, it never
# converges", which was true of one norm only. Not re-measured since the branch
