    Returns zero as shipped, which is a PLACEHOLDER like every number above
    and is almost never what your problem wants. THIS KNOB USED TO BE A SCALAR
    CONSTANT, AND A CONSTANT CANNOT REPRESENT A SOURCE THAT VARIES WITH
    POSITION: the source of a manufactured solution is a POLYNOMIAL in x and y,
    and no single number is that polynomial. Left at zero the temperature is
    harmonic, the outer Dirichlet values are the only data left in the problem,
    and the answer degenerates to the 1-D profile between them — the interface
    flux is one constant along the whole interface, and it is identically zero
    when the two subdomains carry the same outer value. The coupling will
    converge beautifully to that, and it is not the problem you were given.

    If your problem states a source, or gives you a manufactured solution whose
    source term you derived, put it here. `x` and `y` are NumPy arrays, so
    build the answer with NumPy and return ONE array of the same shape (write
    `0.0 * x + c` for a genuine constant, never a bare `c`):

        # -div(K grad T) for the manufactured T = x**3 * y**2
        return -K * (6.0 * x * y**2 + 2.0 * x**3)

    HOW THIS ENTERS NGSolve (your solve below has to do it): NGSolve's symbolic
    `x`, `y` are CoefficientFunctions and carry NO NumPy ufuncs, so do NOT call
    this function on them (np.sin(x) raises; np.zeros_like(x) silently returns
    a 0-d object array and the source collapses to a constant), and do NOT wrap
    the function -- CoefficientFunction(F_SRC) is a TypeError ("incompatible
    constructor arguments", measured). Sample it at the mesh vertices instead,
    np.array([v.point for v in mesh.vertices]), into a P1 GridFunction on your
    space (gf.vec.FV().NumPy()[vertex_dofs] = F_SRC(vx, vy)); a GridFunction IS
    a CoefficientFunction and integrates as gf * v * dx -- the P1 interpolant
    of the source, quadrature error O(h^2), the order of the discretisation.
