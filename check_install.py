"""Did the install work? Answer without an API key and without an AI app.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The README used to end its install section by saying
that if `python -m server` prints "Starting openPASO MCP server", that is
success. It is not. It proves only that Python can import the server. It says
nothing about the solver the reader was told to install two lines earlier, and
every other way of listing solvers goes through a model -- which costs money or
needs an AI app. A reader with neither finished the whole install and had no
way to learn whether anything worked. Measured on someone following the README
for the first time, that was the one thing that stopped them.

So: one command, no key, no network, no model.

    python check_install.py

It prints what openPASO can see on THIS machine and what to type to fix what is
missing, then exits 0 if at least one solver is usable and 1 if none is.
