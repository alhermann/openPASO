"""deal.II participant for the OASiS `couple` driver.

Steady heat conduction  -div(k grad T) = f  on one rectangular subdomain.
CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST.

Pure glue: the PDE solve is done by a compiled deal.II executable THAT YOU
WRITE AND BUILD YOURSELF. No C++ source ships with this contract and none is on
this install, so do not search for one: write a program that reads the side,
the geometry, the material, the mesh size, the source samples and the imported
interface samples from one plain-text file your solve region writes, and
writes the interface trace and the CONSISTENT flux (the residual of the
assembled system with no boundary condition applied, divided by the nodal
interface weight) to a plain-text file your solve region reads back. That pair
of files is private to you. This wrapper is the contract around it: the
imports.json handshake, the sign convention, the exports schema and the
self-check. deal.II has no Python API, so unlike every other backend there is
a BUILD STEP before this can run at all:

    cmake -S <dir with YOUR .cc and a 6-line CMakeLists> -B <build> \
          -DDEAL_II_DIR=<deal.II BUILD or INSTALL tree>
    make -C <build>

and DEALII_EXE below must point at YOUR binary.

    Returns zero as shipped, which is a PLACEHOLDER like every number above
    and is almost never what your problem wants. THIS KNOB USED TO BE A SCALAR
    CONSTANT, AND A CONSTANT CANNOT REPRESENT A SOURCE THAT VARIES WITH
    POSITION: the source of a manufactured solution is a POLYNOMIAL in x and y,
    and no single number is that polynomial. Left at zero the temperature is
    harmonic, the outer Dirichlet values are the only data left in the problem,
    and the answer degenerates to the 1-D profile between them — the interface
    flux is one constant along the whole interface, and it is identically zero
    when the two subdomains carry the same outer value. The coupling will
    converge beautifully to that, and it is not the problem you were given.

    If your problem states a source, or gives you a manufactured solution whose
    source term you derived, put it here. `x` and `y` are NumPy arrays, so
    build the answer with NumPy and return ONE array of the same shape (write
    `0.0 * x + c` for a genuine constant, never a bare `c`):

        # -div(K grad T) for the manufactured T = x**3 * y**2
        return -K * (6.0 * x * y**2 + 2.0 * x**3)

    THIS PARTICIPANT DRIVES A COMPILED SOLVER: your solve region below has to
    carry the samples of F_SRC to your binary (for example on a uniform grid in
    the input file) and your binary has to assemble the volume integral of f times v from them. A
    solver that never reads the source returns the boundary-data-only solution
    with no error anywhere, so have the binary announce what it read and make
    your wrapper refuse a non-zero F_SRC that produced no announcement.
