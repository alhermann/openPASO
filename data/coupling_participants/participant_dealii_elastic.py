"""deal.II VECTOR participant for the OASiS `couple` driver.

Plane-strain linear elasticity  -div(sigma(u)) = 0  on ONE rectangular
subdomain of a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X. The
exchanged interface state is a VECTOR on BOTH channels:

    values        = displacement       u = (u_x, u_y)   at the interface nodes
    normal_fluxes = interface traction export, q_out = -(sigma . n_own)

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST.

Pure glue: the PDE solve is done by a compiled deal.II executable THAT YOU
WRITE AND BUILD YOURSELF. No C++ source ships with this contract and none is on
this install, so do not search for one: write a program that reads the side,
the geometry, the material, the mesh size, the source samples and the imported
interface samples from one plain-text file your solve region writes, and
writes the interface trace and the CONSISTENT flux (the residual of the
assembled system with no boundary condition applied, divided by the nodal
interface weight) to a plain-text file your solve region reads back. That pair
of files is private to you. This wrapper is the contract around it: the
imports.json handshake, the sign convention, the exports schema and the
self-check. deal.II has no Python API, so unlike every other backend there is
a BUILD STEP before this can run at all:

    cmake -S <dir with YOUR .cc and a 6-line CMakeLists> -B <build> \
          -DDEAL_II_DIR=<deal.II BUILD or INSTALL tree>
    make -C <build>

and DEALII_EXE below must point at YOUR binary.
