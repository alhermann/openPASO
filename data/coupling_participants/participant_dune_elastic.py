"""DUNE-fem VECTOR participant for the openPASO `couple` driver.

Plane-strain linear elasticity  -div(sigma(u)) = f  on ONE rectangular
subdomain of a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X (or
y = IFACE_X when IFACE_AXIS is "y"). Unlike the
scalar (heat) participants, the exchanged interface state is a VECTOR on BOTH
channels:

    values        = displacement       u = (u_x, u_y)   at the interface nodes
    normal_fluxes = interface traction export            (SIGN CONVENTION below)

Both lists therefore carry ONE ENTRY PER COMPONENT per interface point —
`[[vx, vy], ...]`, exactly like participant_fenics_elastic.py /
participant_skfem_elastic.py / participant_ngsolve_elastic.py. A flat list of
scalars is a different interface and the partner will silently mis-read it.

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1, so an
iteration-1 fallback is required), writes exports.json LAST, exits 0. The same
points in the same order every iteration — the driver relaxes export vectors
element by element and refuses a length that changes.

SIGN CONVENTION — the thing a vector coupling gets wrong silently.
`normal_fluxes` is exported as

    q_out = -(sigma . n_own)                       n_own = S * e_x

the SAME convention the shipped scalar participants use for heat
(q_out = -k dT/dn_own) and the one the other *_elastic participants use. Two
consequences, both load-bearing:

  * the two sides' exports CANCEL componentwise, because n_own is anti-parallel
    across the interface — that is what makes the interface balance check a
    conservation statement rather than an accident;
  * the NEUMANN side applies the partner's numbers UNCHANGED, as
    `+ dot(g, v) * ds`, because the natural boundary term of the elasticity
    weak form is +(sigma . n_own) . v = +q_out_partner . v.

Exporting the raw traction (sigma . n_own) instead flips the sign the Neumann
side applies; the iteration still converges, to the wrong answer.

WHICH BLOCK TAKES THE DIRICHLET ROLE IS NOT A FREE CHOICE. The
Dirichlet-Neumann iteration contracts only while theta < 2/(1 + mu_max), with
mu the spectrum of S_N^-1 S_D — for two blocks of the same shape, roughly the
stiffness ratio of the DIRICHLET block to the NEUMANN one. Put the STIFFER
block on the Dirichlet side and that bound drops below 1, i.e. below the top of
the driver's Aitken clamp, and the residual plateaus instead of falling.
Measured with this file against participant_skfem_elastic.py on a 2:1
shear-modulus contrast: stiffer-block-Dirichlet PLATEAUED at 3.9e-06 after 300
iterations (Aitken pinned at theta = 0.69, the stability limit); the identical
problem with the SOFTER block on the Dirichlet side reached 9.3e-11 in 63.
Nothing in either participant changes — only which one is given SIDE =
"dirichlet". If a coupling here stalls at a residual that will not fall, swap
the roles before touching theta.

DUNE-FEM SPECIFICS that this file exists to get right:

  * a VECTOR Lagrange space is `lagrange(gridView, order=1, dimRange=2)`, and
    its `as_numpy` vector is INTERLEAVED: the scalar index of component c at
    node n is n*2 + c. Nothing in the API says so, and a blocked (all x, then
    all y) reading produces an interface of the right length whose every number
    is wrong, so the layout is ASSERTED at run time below rather than assumed.
  * `structuredGrid` gives a cube grid, i.e. Q1 elements here. The interface
    nodes are the y-line of nodes at x = IFACE_X.
  * DUNE compiles the UFL forms with a C++ JIT on first use. The first run of a
    new form takes tens of seconds to minutes; that is NOT a hang. Every form
    below is therefore built ONCE and kept fixed across coupling iterations —
    the changing interface data lives in the DOFs of a discrete function, never
    in the form — so only the first iteration pays the compile.
  * DUNE's DirichletBC is evaluated per boundary intersection, so two BCs whose
    indicators overlap at a corner node fight over that node in an unspecified
    order. This file therefore uses exactly ONE DirichletBC whose value is a
    single discrete function carrying BOTH the outer data and (on the Dirichlet
    side) the imported interface data. There is nothing left to overlap.

#
# WHY NOT AN L2 PROJECTION OF THE STRESS. That is what this file and its
# siblings used to do on the Neumann side: project -(sigma(u_h) . n_own) over
# the whole subdomain and sample it at the interface. The gradient of a P1/Q1
# solution — and therefore the stress — is only O(h) accurate ON the boundary;
# the superconvergence points are interior, and the boundary trace is exactly
# what the coupling reads. Measured against a manufactured solution with a known
# exact interface traction, the projection converges at order ~1 while the
# consistent traction below converges at ~2, so the recovery, not the physics
# and not the partner, was setting the answer.
#
# THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) TRACTION — ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. From
#     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (sigma(u) . n) . v ds = -int_Gamma q_out . v ds
# (the second equality is this file's sign convention, q_out = -(sigma . n_own))
# it follows that for every vector basis function phi_i on the interface
#     int_Gamma q_out . phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b_vol
# with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual and b_vol the VOLUME load ALONE: the body
# force and nothing from the interface. Drop the body force and the reaction is
# wrong by the load it carries; leave the interface term in and the Neumann side
# reads back zero.
#
# THAT SECOND FAILURE IS WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A SECOND BRANCH HERE. An earlier
# version used this reaction on the Dirichlet side and the projected stress on
# the Neumann side, reasoning that the Neumann interface dofs are free, so r
# comes out ~0 there. That holds only when the residual is taken against a load
# that ALREADY CONTAINS the interface term. Against b_vol those same rows carry
# exactly the interface functional the partner applied, int_Gamma t . phi_i ds,
# so the export comes back as -t — this file's sign convention, the two sides'
# tractions cancelling. On the Dirichlet side there is no interface term, so
# b == b_vol and the two cases are one expression.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS ONLY ALGEBRA. Handing the NEUMANN side a
# traction and asking for it back is an ASSEMBLY IDENTITY, not a convergence
# test: on free interface rows r = A u - b_vol IS M_Gamma g, so the export is
# -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset from -g is -(h^2/6) g''(y) for ANY
# correct assembly of ANY equation. The "order 2.00" that used to stand here
# was read off that fixture; it is a property of the P1 boundary mass matrix,
# not of this code — a bare NumPy mass matrix reproduces the same numbers with
# no PDE, no solver and no material in it. That fixture is kept
# (tests/test_interface_flux_recovery.py) for what it really tests: sign
# convention, interface weight, facet set, and the interleaved-dof mapping
# below.
#
# THE ORDER is measured on the DIRICHLET side against an ANALYTIC interface
# flux the participant is never handed
# (tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py). FEniCSx, the
# scalar conduction version of this same formulation, 8/16/32/64 uniform

# and only first order (1.10, 1.06, 1.04) at the two nodes where the interface
# meets the outer boundary. There is no VECTOR measurement against an analytic
# traction, and none is claimed.
#
# THE RETIRED L2-PROJECTED GRADIENT, in the norms it was measured in: order ~1
# in the interior AWAY FROM THE ENDS (0.93), 0.50 in rms, and non-convergent in
