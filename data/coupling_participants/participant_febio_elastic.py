"""FEBio 4 VECTOR participant for the openPASO `couple` driver.

Plane-strain linear elasticity  -div(sigma(u)) = b  on ONE rectangular
subdomain of a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X (or
y = IFACE_X when IFACE_AXIS is "y"), with the
body force b given by B_SRC in the edit block. Like the
other *_elastic participants (and unlike the scalar ones), the exchanged
interface state is a VECTOR on BOTH channels:

    values        = displacement       u = (u_x, u_y)   at the interface nodes
    normal_fluxes = interface traction export            (SIGN CONVENTION below)

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST.

FEBio HAS NO SCRIPTING API: it is XML-in / logfile-out. This module is a
WRAPPER that each coupling iteration (1) reads imports.json, (2) writes a
complete FEBio 4.0 .feb deck with the imported interface data baked in PER
NODE, (3) runs `febio4 -i deck.feb`, (4) parses the ASCII <logfile>, (5) writes
exports.json.

PLANE STRAIN IN A 3-D CODE. FEBio solves 3-D solids only, so the subdomain is
meshed as ONE layer of hex8 elements of thickness ZTHICK with u_z = 0 on every
node. That is plane strain exactly, not approximately: the solution is
z-invariant, so the two z-layers of nodes carry identical (u_x, u_y) and the
slab collapses onto the 2-D interface line the other participants speak. The
exported points are therefore the DISTINCT y values of the interface, with
2-D coordinates [IFACE_X, y] — the same list the *_elastic siblings export.

SIGN CONVENTION — the thing a vector coupling gets wrong silently.
`normal_fluxes` is exported as

    q_out = -(sigma . n_own)                       n_own = S * e_x

the SAME convention the shipped scalar participants use for heat
(q_out = -k dT/dn_own) and the one participant_fenics_elastic.py and
participant_skfem_elastic.py use. Two consequences, both load-bearing:

  * the two sides' exports CANCEL componentwise, because n_own is anti-parallel
    across the interface — that is what makes the interface balance check a
    conservation statement rather than an accident;
  * the NEUMANN side applies the partner's numbers UNCHANGED, because the
    natural boundary term of the elasticity weak form is
    +(sigma . n_own) . v = +q_out_partner . v.

Exporting the raw traction (sigma . n_own) instead flips the sign the Neumann
side applies; the iteration still converges, to the wrong answer.

THE TRACTION EXPORT IS PER NODE, AND IT IS THE REACTION — NOT A DOMAIN AVERAGE
AND NOT A STRESS PROJECTION.

The scalar participant_febio.py exports
    q_out = np.full(len(iface_nodes), -mean(element sx) * S)
i.e. ONE domain-averaged sigma_xx broadcast onto every interface point. For its
own 1-D bar that is the exact answer (sigma_xx really is constant there). For
any problem whose interface traction VARIES ALONG THE INTERFACE — a
shear-modulus jump, a non-uniform load, anything two-dimensional — it is not
even first-order accurate: the exported profile is flat, so its error does not
shrink when the mesh is refined, and the Neumann partner is handed a boundary
condition that is simply wrong at both ends of the interface. MEASURED on the
manufactured two-material problem below, whose interface traction is
t_x = K*y (exactly linear in y): the domain-average export sits at the midpoint
value, its relative L2 error along the interface is 45.4% / 45.0% / 44.8% /
44.8% on the four refinement levels — CONVERGENCE ORDER 0.01, 0.00, 0.00 — and
its worst pointwise relative error is 50.0% on every mesh. Refining does not
help, because the error is not a discretisation error.

What is exported instead is the variationally consistent (reaction) traction,
the same recovery every other participant in this corpus uses. From

    a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (sigma(u) . n) . v ds = -int_Gamma q_out . v ds

(the second equality is this file's sign convention, q_out = -(sigma . n_own))
it follows that for every vector basis function phi_i on the interface

    int_Gamma q_out . phi_i ds = -r_i,    r = A u_h - b

with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual — assembled with no boundary condition
applied and with the constrained rows NOT zeroed, because on the Dirichlet side
those rows ARE the reaction. FEBio exposes exactly that vector: the node log
variables "Rx","Ry","Rz" return FESolidSolver2::m_Fr at PRESCRIBED dofs, and
m_Fr is accumulated in FEResidualVector::Assemble as -(sum of the assembled
element vectors) = F_internal - F_external = (A u_h - b)_i. So

    q_i = -R_i / w_i,      w_i = int_Gamma phi_i ds

with w_i the interface nodal weight, computed here in closed form from the
quad4 interface faces (2x2 Gauss on a bilinear face is exact for a planar
quad). The two z-layers of one interface y are summed in BOTH numerator and
denominator, which is the correct collapse of the slab: q = -(R_bot+R_top) /
(w_bot+w_top).

Why not the element stresses. FEBio can log element sx/sxy, and averaging those
onto the interface is the obvious FEBio-shaped alternative. It is a stress
recovered from the GRADIENT of a trilinear solution and evaluated ON a
boundary, which is only O(h) accurate there (the superconvergence points are
interior, and the boundary trace is exactly what the coupling reads). Both
routes were run and measured AT MID-INTERFACE, away from the end effects
discussed below, on the four meshes:

    reaction        (Dirichlet side, and STILL this file's export)
                                                  1.5e-5 1.3e-5 2.8e-6 4.4e-7
    element stress  (the RETIRED Neumann export)  6.2e-3 3.1e-3 1.6e-3 7.8e-4

The element-stress route is order 1.00 flat (0.98, 1.01, 1.00) at that point.
The reaction route drops away much faster (0.23, 2.23, 2.68 — it is running
into this build's own arithmetic floor, see below, so the last figures are a
floor and not an order) and is ~1800x more accurate on the finest mesh. The
recovery, not the physics and not the partner, sets the answer.

READ THE SECOND ROW'S LABEL. The Neumann branch NO LONGER EXPORTS the element
stress; it exports -Fc/w, the consistent nodal force it built and wrote into
the deck, and merely PRINTS the element-stress traction as a second opinion
with its discrepancy. The 6.2e-3 row above is therefore a measurement of a
route this file retired, kept here because it is still the argument for not
going back to it. Order 1.00 is what it gets at a single mid-interface point;
the max norm over interior interface nodes is worse — see the note at the
Neumann export, where it measured 1.638 / 1.440 / 1.500 on 8/16/32, order 0.19
then -0.06, i.e. non-convergent. Both figures are from the original runs and
neither has been re-measured here.

MEASURED, ON A MANUFACTURED TWO-MATERIAL PROBLEM. Unit square split at x = 0.5,
plane strain, a 3x SHEAR-MODULUS JUMP across the interface (mu 400 -> 1200 at
equal lam = 600), exact solution u_x = (a + b x) y, u_y = c x^2 + p x + q per
subdomain — zero body force, and an interface traction t_x = K y that VARIES
LINEARLY ALONG THE INTERFACE, t_y = const. Dirichlet-Neumann against
participant_skfem_elastic.py (P1 triangles) through
core.coupling_driver.run_coupling with Aitken relaxation; four uniformly
refined meshes 8x8 / 16x16 / 32x32 / 64x64 per subdomain; relative L2 errors:

  FEBio = Dirichlet side (it EXPORTS the traction)
    u, over the whole coupled domain   6.212e-4 1.536e-4 3.866e-5 9.756e-6
                                       ORDER 2.02  1.99  1.99
    t, along the interface             6.572e-2 2.329e-2 8.240e-3 2.914e-3
                                       ORDER 1.50  1.50  1.50
  FEBio = Neumann side (it APPLIES the traction)
    u, over the whole coupled domain   6.070e-4 1.476e-4 3.663e-5 9.167e-6
                                       ORDER 2.04  2.01  2.00
    t, exported by the skfem partner   ORDER 1.50  1.50  1.50

DISPLACEMENT IS ORDER 2. THE TRACTION IS ORDER 1.5, AND IT IS NOT THE RECOVERY.
The traction error is a TWO-NODE BOUNDARY LAYER at the two points where the
interface meets the outer Dirichlet boundary: an O(h) amplitude over an O(h)
width integrates to O(h^1.5) in L2 whatever happens in between. Away from it
the exported traction is 1.5e-5 / 1.3e-5 / 2.8e-6 / 4.4e-7 relative at
mid-interface — better than order 2, down to this build's floor. Handed the
EXACT interface displacement instead of a partner's (same participant, run
alone), the recovery reproduces the exact traction at EVERY interface node to
3.0e-7 / 3.2e-7 / 3.3e-7 / 3.9e-7 relative: exact to the floor, with no
h-dependence at all. Running FEBio on BOTH sides gives the same 1.50, so the
layer is not the P1 partner either. Of the two layer nodes, the interface
CORNER is O(h) BY CONSTRUCTION — it is the nearest-interior copy the siblings
also use, measured 12.0% / 6.0% / 3.0% / 1.5%, i.e. exactly h.

CONSERVATION, MEASURED THREE WAYS ON THE SAME RUNS.
  * The consistent nodal load this file bakes into the deck reproduces
    int_Gamma q_partner . phi_i ds over the loaded nodes to 3.8e-16 / 1.7e-16 /
    3.3e-16 / 5.3e-16 relative. The exchange itself is exact.
  * The NET interface force carried by the exported traction matches the exact
    analytic net force to 3.0e-4 / 1.1e-4 / 3.4e-5 / 9.1e-6 (order 1.42 ->
    1.89, heading for 2).
  * WITHDRAWN. This bullet used to report that the two sides' independently
    recovered tractions cancel in the resultant to 6.7e-2 / 3.3e-2 / 1.6e-2 /
    8.2e-3 (order 1.0) against a scikit-fem partner, and to 1.2e-2 / 5.7e-3 /
    2.8e-3 / 1.4e-3 with FEBio on the Neumann side, and it explained the
    residual imbalance as the first-order recovery on the far side. BOTH
    configurations are gone. The first was measured against a
    participant_skfem_elastic.py whose export was then the O(h) stress
    projection; it now exports the consistent reaction. The second was measured
    against THIS file's retired element-stress Neumann export; it now exports
    -Fc/w. The numbers therefore no longer describe anything this corpus ships
    and are not restated as if they did. They have NOT been re-measured, and no
    replacement figure is offered here.

THE NEUMANN SIDE APPLIES CONSISTENT NODAL FORCES, NOT A SURFACE-LOAD MAP.
FEBio's <surface_load type="traction"> reads its vec3 from a SurfaceData map,
and that map is PER FACE, not per face node: FEBioMeshDataSection creates the
FESurfaceMap with the default FMT_MULT storage and FESurfaceMap::setValue
writes the one parsed vector into all m_maxFaceNodes slots of the facet. A
profile that varies along the interface is therefore applied piecewise constant
— an O(h) representation of the boundary data. (That is read off the source,
NOT measured here: the surface-load route was never run, so treat the O(h) as
the standard argument rather than as a number from this test.) What this file
does instead is exactly what `L += inner(g, v) * ds` does in the
FEniCSx/scikit-fem siblings, evaluated here in closed form:

    F_i = int_Gamma t_h . phi_i ds = sum_j M_ij t_j ,
    M = the quad4 surface mass matrix of the interface faces,

with t_h the bilinear interpolant of the partner's NODAL traction samples. The
result is applied as <nodal_load type="nodal_force"> through a vec3 NodeData
map. Same variational statement, no interpolation loss, and it is a standard
FEBio load.

THE BODY FORCE GOES IN THE SAME WAY, AND NOT AS <body_load>. B_SRC in the edit
block is a NumPy function of (x, y) — the same contract the FEniCSx and
scikit-fem siblings use — and it is integrated HERE,

    F_i = int_Omega b . phi_i dV,     3x3x3 Gauss on each hex8,

then applied over ALL nodes through the same vec3 NodeData map machinery, as a
SECOND <nodal_load>. On the Neumann side the interface entry is left exactly as
it was: FEBio adds every model load into the same residual, so the partner's
numbers still reach the solver UNCHANGED, which is what the coupling contract
says. Why not the deck's own body load:

  * it cannot take a polynomial. FEBio 4 registers "const" and "non-const" as
    FEBio-2 loads obsolete since 3.0, and the current "body force"
    (FEGenericBodyForce) carries ONE vec3 `force` parameter. Replacing a
    polynomial source by a constant is not an approximation of the problem, it
    is a different problem. The parameter does accept a math STRING, but then
    the source has to be written twice in two languages, and everything a
    NumPy callable can do that a math string cannot — a table, a np.where, an
    interpolant — is lost;
  * and it would not mean what it says. FEElasticSolidDomain::BodyForce sets
    the integrand to -H[a] * density * f * J0 and assembles it the way INTERNAL
    forces are assembled, so the deck number is multiplied by the material
    density AND enters with the opposite sign: <force>f</force> applies a
    physical body force of MINUS f. Measured, not inferred — the two routes
    agree only after the deck value is negated;
  * nothing is given up by integrating here: the rule above is exact through
    degree 5 per direction, and the statement is the same `inner(b, v) * dx`
    the siblings assemble.

b is a force per unit VOLUME, the same number the 2-D siblings take. The slab's
volume integral, its stiffness and its interface load each carry one factor of
ZTHICK, so it cancels and the solution stays thickness-independent.

AND THE DIRICHLET SIDE MUST TAKE IT BACK OUT OF THE REACTION. m_Fr, the vector
behind the Rx/Ry log data, is accumulated ONLY in
FEResidualVector::Assemble(en, elm, fe) — the ELEMENT path — so internal forces
and element-based loads land in it. A nodal load does not go through that path:
FENodalLoad::LoadVector calls the scalar FEResidualVector::Assemble(node, dof,
f), which adds to m_R when the equation number is >= 0 and otherwise DROPS f
(it only hands it to the rigid solver). At a prescribed dof m_Fr is therefore
F_int alone, while the reaction identity needs r = A u_h - b with the FULL b.
The traction export below subtracts the body-force entries by hand — the same
array that was written into the deck, so nothing is approximated. Omitting that
correction leaves an error of b_i / w_i ~ |b| h / 2, i.e. O(h), on a quantity
that is otherwise second order.

That is read off the source, and then MEASURED both ways. The assembly path
first: one constant load applied once as this file's <nodal_load> and once as
FEBio's own <body_load> gives displacements identical to 1e-15 absolute
(1.7e-12 relative) — so the consistent vector below IS the load FEBio would
have integrated itself — and reactions differing by exactly the consistent body
load, to 5e-15 on values of 5.5e-4. Then the export, on the manufactured
solution u_x = K x y (y - 1), u_y = 0, whose trace on all three OUTER faces is
identically zero (UDX = UDY = 0 represents it exactly) and whose source
b = (-2 mu K x, -(mu + lam) K (2y - 1)) is a genuine polynomial. Exported
traction against the closed-form -(sigma . n_own), the exact interface
displacement handed in through imports.json, meshes 8/16/32/64, relative L2
over the interface minus its two corners:

    correction ON    2.51e-2  6.39e-3  1.61e-3  4.06e-4   ORDER 1.97 1.99 1.99
    correction OFF   5.61e-2  3.32e-2  1.80e-2  9.40e-3   ORDER 0.76 0.88 0.94

Second order with it, first order without it, and 23x worse on the finest mesh.
With a CONSTANT source instead (quadratic manufactured u, where the Q1 solution
is nodally exact) the corrected export sits at the finite-strain floor
discussed below — 6.3e-6 relative on all four meshes, no h-dependence — while
the uncorrected one runs 9.75e-2 4.84e-2 2.41e-2 1.20e-2, order 1.01 1.01 1.00.

WHAT IS APPROXIMATED, HONESTLY.

  * FEBio has no small-strain material. `isotropic elastic` is
    St.Venant-Kirchhoff: Cauchy stress (1/J) F (lam tr(E) I + 2 mu E) F^T with E
    the Green-Lagrange strain. It is linear elasticity only as |grad u| -> 0,
    with a relative error O(|grad u|). If your displacements are LARGE this
    participant is solving finite strain, which may be what you want — but then
    it is no longer the same equation the linear siblings solve, and the
    coupling is only consistent if the partner is also finite-strain.
  * THERE IS AN ACCURACY FLOOR IN THE RECOVERED TRACTION, and it is a
    U-shaped function of the displacement amplitude, so it cannot be made
    arbitrarily small. Above it sits the O(|grad u|) nonlinearity just
    described; below it sits roundoff, because the finite-strain kinematics
    forms F from CURRENT nodal positions X + u with X = O(1), so |grad u|
    carries an absolute roundoff ~1e-16 and therefore a relative one
    ~1e-16/|grad u|. Measured at 32x32 with |grad u| = 2.8e-6 / 2.8e-7 /
    2.8e-8 / 2.8e-9: 3.3e-6 / 3.3e-7 / 5.0e-7 / 5.4e-6 relative error in the
    recovered traction — a minimum of ~3e-7 around |grad u| ~ 3e-7 (the exact
    minimum was not bracketed further). Consequences:
    scale your problem so |grad u| lands near that minimum, and do not ask the
    `couple` driver for a residual tolerance below ~1e-7 when FEBio is the
    DIRICHLET side — there the noisy reaction IS the exported quantity the
    driver's residual is measured on. Measured: at tol=1e-8 the driver reported
    NOT CONVERGED on the two finest meshes, residual stalled at 3.2e-8 and
    4.8e-8; at tol=1e-7 the same four runs converge in 37/39/41/43 Aitken
    iterations and every error above is unchanged to four digits. The stall is
    arithmetic, not an unsettled interface — but the driver is right to refuse
    to certify it, so ask for a tolerance the solver can actually reach. With
    FEBio only on the NEUMANN side, tol=1e-8 converged on all four meshes.
  * hex8 is TRILINEAR. In-plane that is Q1, not the P1 of the scikit-fem/FEniCSx
    siblings, so the two sides of a coupling have different (both O(h^2))
    discretisation errors. That is normal for a partitioned coupling and is not
    an inconsistency.
  * This build of FEBio has NO pardiso (NumCore registers it only under
    #ifdef PARDISO, and FENewtonSolver's default type is the string "pardiso"
    regardless). LINSOLVE below is therefore set to "skyline", which this build
    always has. Leaving it unset works only where pardiso was compiled in.
  * The Neumann side cannot use the reaction: FEBio reports Rx = Ry = 0 at
    free dofs. What it exports instead is -Fc/w, the CONSISTENT NODAL FORCE
    this wrapper built from the partner's traction and wrote into the deck,
    divided by the same interface weight the Dirichlet branch uses. That is a
    measurement of what entered the load vector — a wrong facet set, a wrong
    Jacobian or a wrong surface mass matrix all move it — but it is NOT a
    measurement of the discretised solution: it never passes through FEBio's
    solver, so it cannot see a fault inside FEBio's own load path, and it is
    close to an echo of the partner's array in everything except the assembly.
    The interface balance check against a Dirichlet partner is therefore
    weaker on this pairing than the header used to claim, and the element
    stress is kept as the genuinely independent second opinion — PRINTED with
    its discrepancy, not exported, because it does not converge in the max norm
    over interior interface nodes (see the note at that code). A previous
    version of this bullet said the Neumann export IS the element-stress
    recovery "so the interface balance check is an independent statement rather
    than an echo". Both halves were false once the export changed.

RELAXATION IS NOT PER COMPONENT — see the long note in
participant_skfem_elastic.py. The driver applies ONE theta to the whole
interface state and the optimal theta is set by the WORST component, so
subdomains of the same length and Poisson ratio (proportional
Steklov-Poincare operators) are the well-behaved case; anything else wants
`accelerator="aitken"`.
