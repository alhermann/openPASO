    CONSTANT, AND A CONSTANT CANNOT REPRESENT A SOURCE THAT VARIES WITH
    POSITION: the source of a manufactured solution is a POLYNOMIAL in x and y,
    and no single number is that polynomial. Left at zero the temperature is
    harmonic, the outer Dirichlet values are the only data left in the problem,
    and the answer degenerates to the 1-D profile between them — the interface
    flux is one constant along the whole interface, and it is identically zero
    when the two subdomains carry the same outer value. The coupling will
    converge beautifully to that, and it is not the problem you were given.

    If your problem states a source, or gives you a manufactured solution whose
    source term you derived, put it here. `x` and `y` are NumPy arrays, so
    build the answer with NumPy and return ONE array of the same shape (write
    `0.0 * x + c` for a genuine constant, never a bare `c`):

    carries no NumPy ufuncs, so do NOT call this function on
    ufl.SpatialCoordinate (np.zeros_like(x) does not even raise -- it returns
    a 0-d object array and the source collapses to a constant). Interpolate it
    into a P1 Function on your space instead, f_h.interpolate(lambda X:
    F_SRC(X[0], X[1])), and integrate f_h * v * dx -- the P1 interpolant of the

# superconvergence points are interior — and the boundary trace is exactly what
# the coupling reads. The consistent flux below is second order against an
# analytic interface flux: 1.996, 1.998, 1.993 on 8/16/32/64, re-measured on
# this file by tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py.
# (The original sweep that retired the projection reported 1.07 for it against
# 2.05 for the reaction, and a coupled graded field order moving from 1.83 to
# 2.05 against a pass band ending at 1.6. Those three figures are from that
# sweep and have NOT been re-run since the projected branch was deleted; the
# 1.996/1.998/1.993 above is the number this repo can reproduce today.) The
# recovery, not the physics and not the partner, was setting the answer.
#
# THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) FLUX. From
#     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (K grad u . n) v ds = -int_Gamma qn v ds
# it follows that for every basis function phi_i on the interface
#     int_Gamma qn phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b
# with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual: assembled with no boundary condition
# applied and with the constrained rows NOT zeroed, because on the Dirichlet
# side those rows ARE the reaction and zeroing them destroys the very quantity
# being recovered. Dividing by w_i = int_Gamma phi_i ds turns the functional
# into a density the partner can interpolate pointwise.
p_, w_ = ufl.TrialFunction(V), ufl.TestFunction(V)

# ── SOLVE ─ OASiS DOES NOT SERVE THIS ─ end
# ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. An earlier version of this file used the reaction
# only on the Dirichlet side and an L2-projected gradient on the Neumann side,
# on the reasoning that the Neumann interface DOFs are free, so the discrete
# equations hold on them and r comes out ~0. That is true only when the
# residual is taken against a load that ALREADY CONTAINS the interface term.
# Subtract the VOLUME load alone and those same rows carry exactly the
# interface functional the partner applied:
#     (A u - b_vol)_i = int_Gamma g phi_i ds
# On the Dirichlet side there is no interface term at all, so b == b_vol and
# the two cases are the same expression.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS ONLY ALGEBRA. Two different fixtures, and only
# one of them is a convergence result. Do not quote the first as one.
#
#  (1) ASSEMBLY IDENTITY, not convergence. Handing THIS side a flux g and
#      asking for it back cannot measure an order: on free interface rows
#      r = A u - b_vol IS M_Gamma g by construction, so the export is the
#      consistent-to-nodal conversion -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset
#      from -g is -(h^2/6) g''(y) for ANY correct assembly of ANY equation,
#      with any conductivity. Measured for q = 2 + 3 sin(4y) at n = 8/16/32:
#      1.964339e-02, 4.983320e-03, 1.249629e-03 — the same figures a bare 1-D
#      P1 mass matrix in NumPy produces with no PDE, no solver and no material
#      in it. This used to be quoted here as "order 2.00"; it is not evidence
#      of an order. The fixture is kept (tests/test_interface_flux_recovery.py)
#      because it does catch a flipped sign, a wrong weight, a mistagged facet
#      set and a blocked-dof mix-up — a real but narrow check.
#
#  (2) THE ORDER, measured on the DIRICHLET side against an analytic interface
#      flux this file is never given
#      (tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py):
#      T = 300 + sin(3x) cos(pi y/Ly) drives THIS script unmodified — its
#      natural top/bottom and its constant T_OUTER are exactly right for it —
#      and the graded quantity is q_ex = -3 K cos(3 X1) cos(pi y/Ly), a
#      different quantity from the temperature handed in. FEniCSx, 8/16/32/64
#      uniform triangle meshes, max error over INTERIOR interface nodes:
#          2.889e-01  7.243e-02  1.814e-02  4.556e-03   ORDER 1.996 1.998 1.993
#      At the two nodes where the interface meets the outer boundary it is only
#      first order (1.529, 7.142e-01, 3.415e-01, 1.663e-01; order 1.10, 1.06,
#      1.04) even where no end fix-up applies — the end of an interface is a
#      different quantity and is reported apart throughout this corpus.
#
#  (3) THE RETIRED PROJECTED GRADIENT, in the norms it was actually measured
#      in: order ~1 in the interior AWAY FROM THE ENDS (0.93), 0.50 in rms, and
#      non-convergent in the max norm that includes the near-end nodes, where
#      it stalls at 2.6 against a true flux of size 2 to 5. It was written up
#      here as a flat "order 0.00, it never converges", which was true of one
#      norm and was not labelled as such. Order ~1 is what a P1 gradient
#      evaluated ON a boundary is worth, and is the honest reason to prefer the
#      second-order reaction. Not re-measured since the branch was deleted.

# At convergence the two fluxes are equal and opposite, and that is a RESULT,
# not a recipe. Setting q_B = -q_A makes it true by construction, and then the
# only quantity the coupling is judged on carries no information: the two sides
# agree because they are one array with a sign flip.
#
# It is detected exactly. Two independently assembled systems do not cancel to
# the last bit, so the grader treats a bit-exact zero jump as no evidence of
# two solves at all. A real converged pair leaves a small residual mismatch —
# about the size of your interface tolerance — and that mismatch is what shows
# the coupling happened.
#
# Seen in a live run: q_A = -1.525074442746e+00 against q_B = +1.525074442746e+00
# at every one of 44 interface points, summing to exactly 0.000e+00, from an
# agent whose iteration history was otherwise genuine. It had driven a real
# Dirichlet-Neumann loop and then faked the one number that proves it.
