"""FEniCSx (dolfinx) VECTOR participant for the OASiS `couple` driver.

Plane-strain linear elasticity  -div(sigma(u)) = 0  on ONE rectangular
subdomain of a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X. Unlike the
scalar (heat) participants, the exchanged interface state is a VECTOR on BOTH
channels:

    values        = displacement       u = (u_x, u_y)   at the interface nodes
    normal_fluxes = interface traction export            (SIGN CONVENTION below)

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST.

SIGN CONVENTION — the thing a vector coupling gets wrong silently.
`normal_fluxes` is exported as

    q_out = -(sigma . n_own)                       n_own = S * e_x

the SAME convention the shipped scalar participants use for heat
(q_out = -k dT/dn_own). Two consequences, both load-bearing:

  * the two sides' exports CANCEL componentwise, because n_own is anti-parallel
    across the interface — that is what makes the interface balance check a
    conservation statement rather than an accident;
  * the NEUMANN side applies the partner's numbers UNCHANGED, as
    `L += inner(g, v) * ds`, because the natural boundary term of the
    elasticity weak form is +(sigma . n_own) . v = +q_out_partner . v.

Exporting the raw traction (sigma . n_own) instead flips the sign the Neumann
side applies; the iteration still converges, to the wrong answer.

#
# WHY NOT AN L2 PROJECTION OF THE STRESS. That is what this file used to do on
# the Neumann side: project -(sigma(u_h) . n_own) over the whole subdomain and
# sample it at the interface. The gradient of a P1 solution — and therefore the
# stress — is only O(h) accurate ON the boundary; the superconvergence points
# are interior, and the boundary trace is exactly what the coupling reads.
# Measured earlier against a manufactured solution with a known exact interface
# traction, the projection converged at order ~1 while the consistent traction
# below converged at ~2, so the recovery, not the physics and not the partner,
# was setting the answer. (That is a different experiment from the one under
# MEASURED below, which imposes a traction and asks for it back; there the
# projection does not merely lose an order, it does not converge at all.)
#
# THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) TRACTION. From
#     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (sigma(u) . n) . v ds = -int_Gamma q_out . v ds
# (the second equality is this file's sign convention, q_out = -(sigma . n_own))
# it follows that for every vector basis function phi_i on the interface
#     int_Gamma q_out . phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b_vol
# with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual: assembled with no boundary condition
# applied and with the constrained rows NOT zeroed, because on the Dirichlet
# side those rows ARE the reaction.
#
# ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. An earlier version of this file used that reaction
# only on the Dirichlet side and the L2-projected stress on the Neumann side,
# on the reasoning that the Neumann interface dofs are free, so the discrete
# equations hold on them and r comes out ~0. That is true only when the
# residual is taken against a load that ALREADY CONTAINS the interface term.
# Subtract the VOLUME load alone and those same rows carry exactly the
# interface functional the partner applied, componentwise:
#     (A u - b_vol)_(i,c) = int_Gamma g_c phi_i ds
# On the Dirichlet side there is no interface term at all, so b == b_vol and
# the two cases are the same expression.
#
# MEASURED ON THIS FILE, on the Neumann side, by handing it a traction that
# VARIES along the interface — t = (2 + 3 sin 4y, -1 + 2 cos 3y), as if a
# partner had exported it — and asking for it back. Interior interface nodes,
# n = 8/16/32 uniform triangle meshes, non-zero body force, max error per
# component (the two ends are outer-Dirichlet, a different quantity, and are
# reported apart):
#     projected stress   tx 3.26, 4.54, 5.84   ty 6.52, 7.06, 7.84
#                        orders -0.11, -0.15 — it does not converge, it GROWS,
#                        against a true traction whose size is 1 to 5
#     reaction vs b_vol  tx 1.96e-02, 4.98e-03, 1.25e-03
#                        ty 7.40e-03, 1.87e-03, 4.68e-04
#
# READ THE SECOND ROW CORRECTLY — IT IS NOT A CONVERGENCE RESULT. On the
# Neumann side the free interface rows satisfy (A u - b_vol)_i = (M_Gamma g)_i
# IDENTICALLY, so the export is the consistent-to-nodal conversion
# -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset from -g is -(h^2/6) g''(y) for ANY
# correct assembly of ANY equation, at ANY Poisson ratio. This row used to
# carry "orders 1.98, 2.00" as if it measured the recovery's accuracy; it does
# not. The x-component figures matching the scalar conduction participants to
# three digits is NOT "a property of the discretisation rather than of an
# implementation" as this comment used to claim — it is the same P1 boundary
# mass matrix on the same interface nodes with the same g, and a bare NumPy
# mass matrix with no PDE, no solver and no material in it reproduces them to
# five significant figures. The recovery's ORDER is measured elsewhere, on the
# DIRICHLET side against an analytic flux
# (tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py): 1.996, 1.998,
# 1.993 on 8/16/32/64, scalar conduction. There is no VECTOR measurement
# against an analytic traction, and none is claimed here.
#
# WHAT THE FIXTURE IS STILL GOOD FOR: it fails loudly on a flipped sign, a
# wrong interface weight, a mistagged facet set, and — the standing footgun of
# this file — a blocked-dof mapping that divides one node's component by
# another node's weight. The projected-stress row above is a genuine
# measurement: it passes through the discretisation. The Dirichlet side is
# untouched by this change (b == b_vol there): its export is bit-identical to
# the previous version's, checked.
#
# THE WEIGHT IS ONE SCALAR PER NODE AND THE DOFS ARE BLOCKED. V carries two
# scalar dofs per node, at array positions 2*n and 2*n+1, while the nodal
# interface weight w_n = int_Gamma phi_n ds is a SINGLE number for the node.
# Taking the test vector (1,1) in the weight form puts that same number at BOTH
# block entries — the basis function of dof (n,c) is phi_n * e_c and
# inner((1,1), phi_n e_c) = phi_n whatever c is — so indexing with the
# (n_iface, 2) block index array below divides every component of a node by that
# node's own scalar weight. Do NOT index a blocked array with `iface_n` itself:
# those are NODE numbers, and entry n of a blocked array is component n % 2 of
# node n // 2, i.e. a different node's dof, silently.
