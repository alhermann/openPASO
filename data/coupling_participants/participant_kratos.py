"""Kratos Multiphysics participant for the OASiS `couple` driver (DIRICHLET side).

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST. Needs KratosMultiphysics + ConvectionDiffusionApplication
importable in the interpreter named in `command`.

This is the DIRICHLET side: it imports the partner's `values` (interface temperature), applies them as fixed nodal
TEMPERATURE on the interface, exports temperature + its own outward normal flux.

Slab [X0, X1] x [0, H], conductivity K.
  x = X0 : Dirichlet T = T_OUTER (hot side)
  x = X1 : INTERFACE, Dirichlet T = imported partner values (interpolated over y)
  top/bot: insulated (natural)

The exported outward normal flux density is the CONSISTENT (reaction) flux, not
a difference quotient of the solution — see the block above the export below.

    # only O(h) accurate ON the boundary — the superconvergence points are
    # interior — and the boundary trace is exactly what the coupling reads.
    # Measured against a manufactured solution with a known exact interface
