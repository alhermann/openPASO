"""Kratos Multiphysics participant for the OASiS `couple` driver (NEUMANN side).

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1, so an
iteration-1 fallback is mandatory), writes exports.json LAST and exits 0.
Needs KratosMultiphysics + ConvectionDiffusionApplication importable in the
interpreter named in `command`. DO NOT GUESS THAT INTERPRETER: take it from
`discover(query='list')`, which reports the one this install actually imports
Kratos with. A system python3 is a common trap — it usually exists, so nothing
looks wrong, and it raises ModuleNotFoundError because the Kratos build targets
a different Python version than the system one.

THE OTHER HALF OF participant_kratos.py. That file is the DIRICHLET side: it
imports the partner's `values` (interface temperature), fixes them as nodal
TEMPERATURE, and exports the consistent REACTION_FLUX. This file is the NEUMANN
side: it imports the partner's `normal_fluxes` and applies them as the natural
boundary condition, then exports the interface TEMPERATURE its solve produced,
which is what a Dirichlet partner consumes.

Physics: steady conduction  -div(K grad T) = f  on one rectangular subdomain of
a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X. Top and bottom edges are
natural (zero flux). The non-interface x-boundary carries a Dirichlet value
T_OUTER.

  x = OUTER_X : Dirichlet T = T_OUTER
  x = IFACE_X : INTERFACE, natural BC = the partner's imported flux
  top/bottom  : insulated (natural, nothing to do)

THE SIGN, WHICH IS THE ONLY THING A NEUMANN PARTICIPANT CAN GET SILENTLY WRONG.
Every participant exports its outward normal flux density with respect to ITS
OWN outward normal,
      q = -(K grad T) . n_own,
so on a shared interface the two sides carry OPPOSITE signs. Integrating the
weak form on THIS subdomain,
      int_Omega K grad T . grad v  =  int_Omega f v  +  int_dOmega (K grad T . n) v ds,
and on the interface n = n_own = -n_partner, so
      K grad T . n_own = -q_own = +q_partner.
The partner's number is therefore applied UNCHANGED — no minus sign anywhere.
Kratos's FluxCondition2D2N enforces exactly  K grad T . n = FACE_HEAT_FLUX
(verified by a patch test: T fixed to 0 at x=0, FACE_HEAT_FLUX=1 on x=1, K=1,
no source -> T(1)=+1.000000, i.e. dT/dx=+1 not -1), so

      FACE_HEAT_FLUX  :=  the imported `normal_fluxes`, verbatim.

If you ever flip that sign to "make the temperatures look right", you have
built a coupling that drives heat the wrong way across the interface and still
converges. The self-check printed at the end of this script is the guard: it
evaluates the discrete divergence theorem on this subdomain and must come out
at round-off.
