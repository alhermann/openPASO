    Returns zero as shipped, which is a PLACEHOLDER like every number above
    and is almost never what your problem wants. THIS KNOB USED TO BE A SCALAR
    CONSTANT, AND A CONSTANT CANNOT REPRESENT A SOURCE THAT VARIES WITH
    POSITION: the source of a manufactured solution is a POLYNOMIAL in x and y,
    and no single number is that polynomial. Left at zero the temperature is
    harmonic, the outer Dirichlet values are the only data left in the problem,
    and the answer degenerates to the 1-D profile between them — the interface
    flux is one constant along the whole interface, and it is identically zero
    when the two subdomains carry the same outer value. The coupling will
    converge beautifully to that, and it is not the problem you were given.

    If your problem states a source, or gives you a manufactured solution whose
    source term you derived, put it here. `x` and `y` are NumPy arrays, so
    build the answer with NumPy and return ONE array of the same shape (write
    `0.0 * x + c` for a genuine constant, never a bare `c`):

        return -K * (6.0 * x * y**2 + 2.0 * x**3)

    HOW THIS ENTERS NGSolve (your solve below has to do it): NGSolve's symbolic
    `x`, `y` are CoefficientFunctions and carry NO NumPy ufuncs, so do NOT call
    this function on them (np.sin(x) raises; np.zeros_like(x) silently returns
    a 0-d object array and the source collapses to a constant), and do NOT wrap
    the function -- CoefficientFunction(F_SRC) is a TypeError ("incompatible
    constructor arguments", measured). Sample it at the mesh vertices instead,
    np.array([v.point for v in mesh.vertices]), into a P1 GridFunction on your
    space (gf.vec.FV().NumPy()[vertex_dofs] = F_SRC(vx, vy)); a GridFunction IS
    a CoefficientFunction and integrates as gf * v * dx -- the P1 interpolant
    of the source, quadrature error O(h^2), the order of the discretisation.

    # interface. The gradient of a P1 solution is only O(h) accurate ON the
    # boundary — the superconvergence points are interior — and the boundary
    # trace is exactly what the coupling reads. Measured against a manufactured
    # solution with a known exact interface flux, the projection converges at
    # order ~1 while the consistent flux below converges at ~2, so the recovery,
    # not the physics and not the partner, was setting the answer.

    # THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) FLUX. From
    #     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (k grad u . n) v ds = -int_Gamma qn v ds
    # it follows that for every basis function phi_i on the interface
    #     int_Gamma qn phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b
    # with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual: NGSolve's a.mat and f.vec are exactly
    # that — the Dirichlet condition lives in fes.FreeDofs() at solve time and
    # never touches the assembled operator, so the constrained rows still carry
    # the reaction. Dividing by w_i = int_Gamma phi_i ds turns the functional
    # into a density the partner can interpolate pointwise.
    # ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. An earlier version used the reaction on the
    # Dirichlet side and an L2-projected gradient on the Neumann side, on the
    # reasoning that the Neumann interface dofs are free, so r comes out ~0
    # there. That holds only when the residual is taken against a load that
    # ALREADY CONTAINS the interface term. Subtract the VOLUME load alone and
    # those same rows carry exactly the interface functional the partner
    # applied. On the Dirichlet side there is no interface term, so f_vol == f
    # and the two cases are one expression.
    #
    # WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS ONLY ALGEBRA. Handing the NEUMANN side a
    # flux and asking for it back is an ASSEMBLY IDENTITY, not a convergence
    # test: on free interface rows r = A u - b_vol IS M_Gamma g, so the export
    # is -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset from -g is -(h^2/6) g''(y) for
    # ANY correct assembly of ANY equation. The "order 2.00" that used to stand
    # here was read off that fixture; it is a property of the P1 boundary mass
    # matrix, not of this code — a bare NumPy mass matrix reproduces the same
    # numbers with no PDE, no solver and no material in it. That fixture is
    # kept (tests/test_interface_flux_recovery.py) for what it really tests:
    # sign convention, interface weight, facet set, blocked dofs.
    #
    # THE ORDER is measured on the DIRICHLET side against an ANALYTIC interface
    # flux the participant is never handed
    # (tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py). FEniCSx,
