"""NGSolve VECTOR participant for the openPASO `couple` driver.

Plane-strain linear elasticity  -div(sigma(u)) = 0  on ONE rectangular
subdomain of a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X (or
y = IFACE_X when IFACE_AXIS is "y"). Unlike the
scalar (heat) participants, the exchanged interface state is a VECTOR on BOTH
channels:

    values        = displacement       u = (u_x, u_y)   at the interface nodes
    normal_fluxes = interface traction export            (SIGN CONVENTION below)

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST.

SIGN CONVENTION — the thing a vector coupling gets wrong silently.
`normal_fluxes` is exported as

    q_out = -(sigma . n_own)                       n_own = S * e_x

the SAME convention the shipped scalar participants use for heat
(q_out = -k dT/dn_own). The two sides' exports therefore CANCEL componentwise,
and the NEUMANN side applies the partner's numbers UNCHANGED
(`f += InnerProduct(g, v) * ds("interface")`), because the natural boundary
term of the elasticity weak form is +(sigma . n_own) . v = +q_out_partner . v.

NGSolve's VectorH1 is BLOCKED BY COMPONENT: GetDofNrs(NodeId(VERTEX, i))
returns (dof of u_x, dof of u_y) and those two indices are nv apart, not
adjacent. Writing nodal values with an adjacency assumption silently scatters
u_y into the u_x block.

    # and therefore the stress — is only O(h) accurate ON the boundary; the
    # superconvergence points are interior, and the boundary trace is exactly
    # what the coupling reads.

    # THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) TRACTION. From
    #     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (sigma(u).n).v ds = -int_Gamma q_out.v ds
    # (the second equality is this file's sign convention) it follows that for
    # every vector basis function phi_i on the interface
    #     int_Gamma q_out . phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b_vol
    # with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual: NGSolve's a.mat and the load vectors
    # are exactly that — the Dirichlet condition lives in fes.FreeDofs() at
    # solve time and never touches the assembled operator, so the constrained
    # rows still carry the reaction.
    #
    # ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. An earlier version used that reaction on the
    # Dirichlet side and the projection on the Neumann side, reasoning that the
    # Neumann interface dofs are free so r comes out ~0 there. That holds only
    # when the residual is taken against a load that ALREADY CONTAINS the
    # interface term. Subtract the VOLUME load alone and those same rows carry
    # exactly the interface functional the partner applied:
    #     (A u - b_vol)_i = int_Gamma g . phi_i ds
    # On the Dirichlet side there is no interface term, so f_vol == f and the
    # two cases are one expression.
    #
    # WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS ONLY ALGEBRA. Handing the NEUMANN side a
    # traction and asking for it back is an ASSEMBLY IDENTITY, not a
    # convergence test: on free interface rows r = A u - b_vol IS M_Gamma g, so
    # the export is -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset from -g is
    # -(h^2/6) g''(y) for ANY correct assembly of ANY equation. The "order
    # 2.00" that used to stand here was read off that fixture; it is a property
    # of the P1 boundary mass matrix, not of this code — a bare NumPy mass
    # matrix reproduces the same numbers with no PDE, no solver and no material
    # in it. That fixture is kept (tests/test_interface_flux_recovery.py) for
    # what it really tests, and for a VECTOR participant the blocked-dof
    # mapping below is exactly the kind of defect it catches.
    #
    # THE ORDER is measured on the DIRICHLET side against an ANALYTIC interface
    # flux the participant is never handed

#    A VECTOR side needs it more, not less: a displacement field that came out
