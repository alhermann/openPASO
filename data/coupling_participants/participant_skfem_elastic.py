"""scikit-fem VECTOR participant for the openPASO `couple` driver.

Plane-strain linear elasticity  -div(sigma(u)) = 0  on ONE rectangular
subdomain of a domain split by a straight interface at x = IFACE_X (or
y = IFACE_X when IFACE_AXIS is "y"). Unlike the
scalar (heat) participants, the exchanged interface state is a VECTOR on BOTH
channels:

    values        = displacement       u = (u_x, u_y)   at the interface nodes
    normal_fluxes = interface traction export            (SIGN CONVENTION below)

CONTRACT (do not change): runs in its work_dir with no arguments, reads
imports.json (written every iteration; it is `{}` on iteration 1), writes
exports.json LAST.

SIGN CONVENTION — the thing a vector coupling gets wrong silently.
`normal_fluxes` is exported as

    q_out = -(sigma . n_own)                       n_own = S * e_x

the SAME convention the shipped scalar participants use for heat
(q_out = -k dT/dn_own) and the one participant_febio.py uses for its 1-D
elastic analogue. Two consequences, both load-bearing:

  * the two sides' exports CANCEL componentwise, because n_own is anti-parallel
    across the interface — that is what makes the interface balance check a
    conservation statement rather than an accident;
  * the NEUMANN side applies the partner's numbers UNCHANGED, as
    `L += dot(g, v) ds`, because the natural boundary term of the elasticity
    weak form is +(sigma . n_own) . v = +q_out_partner . v.

Exporting the raw traction (sigma . n_own) instead flips the sign the Neumann
side applies; the iteration still converges, to the wrong answer.

RELAXATION IS NOT PER COMPONENT. The driver applies ONE theta to the whole
interface state, and the optimal theta is 1/(1+rho) with rho the ratio of the
two subdomains' interface stiffnesses. For a VECTOR interface rho is a matrix,
so u_x and u_y generally want DIFFERENT thetas and the single theta must be
chosen for the WORST component: (1-theta)^2 + rho_c*theta^2 < 1 has to hold for
every component c, so theta < 2/(1+max_c rho_c). Measured on this problem with
traction-free y-faces: rho_x ~ 0.4 while rho_y ~ 1.8, and theta = 1/(1+rho_x)
diverges on the y component while the x component converges — a
half-converging coupling that a single global residual reports only as "did
not converge". Two subdomains of the SAME length and Poisson ratio have
Steklov-Poincare operators that are proportional (S_left = (E_l/E_r) S_right),
so rho collapses to the scalar E_l/E_r and one theta is optimal for both
components; that is why the shipped placeholder geometry splits the strip in
half.

# Interface traction export q_out = -(sigma . n_own).
#
# WHY NOT AN L2 PROJECTION OF THE STRESS. That is what this file used to do on
# the Neumann side: project -(sigma(u_h) . n_own) over the whole subdomain and
# sample it at the interface. The gradient of a P1 solution — and therefore the
# stress — is only O(h) accurate ON the boundary; the superconvergence points
# are interior, and the boundary trace is exactly what the coupling reads.
#
# THE CONSISTENT (REACTION) TRACTION. From
#     a(u,v) - (f,v) = int_dOmega (sigma(u) . n) . v ds = -int_Gamma q_out . v ds
# (the second equality is this file's sign convention, q_out = -(sigma . n_own))
# it follows that for every vector basis function phi_i on the interface
#     int_Gamma q_out . phi_i ds = -r_i,   r = A u_h - b_vol
# with r the UNCONSTRAINED residual: A and the loads are assembled with NO
# boundary condition applied and skfem's condense() returns copies, so the
# constrained rows of A still carry the reaction.
#
# ONE FORMULA, BOTH SIDES. An earlier version used that reaction on the
# Dirichlet side and the projection on the Neumann side, reasoning that the
# Neumann interface dofs are free so r comes out ~0 there. That holds only when
# the residual is taken against a load that ALREADY CONTAINS the interface
# term. Subtract the VOLUME load alone and those same rows carry exactly the
# interface functional the partner applied:
#     (A u - b_vol)_i = int_Gamma g . phi_i ds
# On the Dirichlet side there is no interface term, so b == b_vol and the two
# cases are one expression.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS ONLY ALGEBRA. Handing the NEUMANN side a
# traction and asking for it back is an ASSEMBLY IDENTITY, not a convergence
# test: on free interface rows r = A u - b_vol IS M_Gamma g, so the export is
# -(M_Gamma g)/(M_Gamma 1) and its offset from -g is -(h^2/6) g''(y) for ANY
# correct assembly of ANY equation. The "order 2.00" that used to stand here
# was read off that fixture; it is a property of the P1 boundary mass matrix,
# not of this code — a bare NumPy mass matrix reproduces the same numbers with
# no PDE, no solver and no material in it. That fixture is kept
# (tests/test_interface_flux_recovery.py) for what it really tests, and for a
# VECTOR participant the blocked-dof mapping below is exactly the kind of
# defect it catches and a field-error check does not.
#
# THE ORDER is measured on the DIRICHLET side against an ANALYTIC interface
# flux the participant is never handed
# (tests/test_interface_flux_converges_to_a_known_exact_flux.py). Scalar
# conduction, FEniCSx, the same recovery, 8/16/32/64 uniform triangle meshes,
# max error over interior interface nodes:
#     2.889e-01  7.243e-02  1.814e-02  4.556e-03   ORDER 1.996  1.998  1.993
# and only first order (1.10, 1.06, 1.04) at the two nodes where the interface
# meets the outer boundary, which is why those are handled apart below. There
# is no VECTOR measurement against an analytic traction, and none is claimed.
#
# THE RETIRED L2-PROJECTED GRADIENT, in the norms it was measured in: order ~1
# in the interior AWAY FROM THE ENDS (0.93), 0.50 in rms, and non-convergent in
# the max norm that includes the near-end nodes, where it stalls at 2.6 against
# a true flux of size 2 to 5. It was written up as a flat "order 0.00, it never
# converges", which was true of one norm only. Not re-measured since the branch
# was deleted.
#
# THE WEIGHT IS ONE SCALAR PER NODE, NOT ONE PER DOF. w_i = int_Gamma phi_i ds
# belongs to the NODE, while the dofs are blocked by component; the test vector
# (1,1) in `unit_load` puts that same number on both of a node's dofs, so every
