# Install

!!! important "openPASO is not useful on its own"
    openPASO is the part that drives the solvers. The thinking is done by an AI model, which you
    bring. Before you install, know which of the two ways below you will use. The install itself is
    the same either way.

| | Option A: an AI app | Option B: your own API key |
|---|---|---|
| **You need** | Claude Code, Claude Desktop or Cursor | an account at openrouter.ai |
| **Extra cost** | none beyond your subscription | you pay for what you use |
| **Choice of model** | whatever the app offers | any model on OpenRouter |
| **Good for** | trying it out, everyday work | scripting, experiments, cheap models |

Not sure whether your app works? If you have Claude Code, type `claude mcp list` in a terminal. If
the command exists, use Option A.

## What you need

- **Python 3.10 to 3.13**
- **at least one** solver. You do not need all nine; openPASO tells you what is missing and how to get it.

Check your Python:

```bash
python3 --version    # 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12: go straight on. 3.13: read the box below.
```

??? warning "On Python 3.13 you need a C compiler"
    The install takes about two minutes longer. openPASO keeps numpy below version 2, because the
    preCICE coupling library requires that, and for Python 3.13 no ready-made numpy below version 2
    exists, so `pip` has to compile it.

    - Debian or Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential`
    - macOS: `xcode-select --install`
    - Fedora or RHEL: `sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ make`
    - Windows: install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
      with "Desktop development with C++", **or, much simpler, install Python 3.12** from
      <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.

    Without a compiler the install stops on numpy with `Unknown compiler(s)` and
    `metadata-generation-failed`. Python 3.14 and newer are untested.

    **If your Python is older than 3.10 or newer than 3.13**, install a supported one beside it. They
    live side by side without conflict. With conda: `conda create -n paso python=3.12 && conda activate paso`.

## Install openPASO

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alhermann/openPASO.git
cd openPASO
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install scikit-fem            # the easiest solver to start with
```

Then install the agent packages. Only Option B uses them, but installing them now costs nothing:

```bash
pip install -r langgraph_eval/requirements-langgraph.txt
```

!!! note "Windows"
    Use `python -m venv .venv` and then `.venv\Scripts\activate`. A few other commands differ:
    `copy` instead of `cp`, `dir` instead of `ls`, `set` instead of `export`. openPASO is developed
    and tested on Linux. It should work on Windows, but we do not measure that, and the solvers that
    build from source (4C, SPARTA, deal.II) are the least likely to.

## More solvers

Each solver has its own page with the exact install command and what openPASO knows about it:
see [Solvers](../solvers/index.md). In short:

```bash
pip install ngsolve scikit-fem meshio      # into the same .venv
pip install KratosMultiphysics-all         # Kratos: use the -all package
pip install dune-fem mpi4py                # DUNE-fem: mpi4py is a hidden requirement
conda create -n fenics -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx   # FEniCSx: its own conda environment
```

Any `export NAME=value` line only lasts until you close the terminal. To keep it, add the same line
to the end of `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`).

**If a solver will not install**, ask openPASO once it is connected:
