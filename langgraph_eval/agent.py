"""LangGraph agents for the open-weight ablation.

Two agent constructors:

* :func:`build_bare_agent`  — host-side toolset only (bash + web search +
  spawn_subagent). No OASiS MCP. Mirrors what Claude has in v1 BARE.
* :func:`build_mcp_agent`   — async context manager yielding the same host-side
    toolset plus the campaign OASiS MCP tools. Keep the context open for the full
    run so server-side state survives between calls.

Both conditions get parity with what Claude Code offers natively:

| Host-side tool       | Why both conditions need it                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ``run_bash``        | Equivalent of Claude's Bash; runs scripts/solvers  |
| ``read_file``       | Equivalent of Claude's Read                        |
| ``write_file``      | Equivalent of Claude's Write                       |
| ``web_search``      | Equivalent of Claude's WebSearch (literature/benchmarks) |
| ``spawn_subagent``  | Equivalent of Claude's Agent tool; needed so the   |
|                     | model can fulfil the MANDATORY CRITIC protocol the |
|                     | OASiS server prompts it to follow                  |

MCP_FULL exposes the explicit ``CAMPAIGN_MCP_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`` below. Deprecated
coupling shims and environment-mutating setup/reload tools are deliberately not
part of the experimental surface; adding a tool is a reviewed contract change,
not an automatic side effect of server registration.

All LLM calls go through ``langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`` pointed at a local
vLLM server, which surfaces Qwen2.5's native tool-call format through the
OpenAI schema.
