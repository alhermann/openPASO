"""Run one simulation task with an AI model of your choice.

This is the simplest way to use openPASO. You need two things:
an OpenRouter API key, and a description of what you want to simulate.

    cp .env.example .env        # then paste your key into .env
    python run_agent.py "Solve the Poisson equation on a unit square
                         and check the convergence rate"

The model reads your sentence, picks a solver, writes the input file,
runs the solver, and checks the answer. Everything it does is printed
as it happens, so you can watch and stop it at any time with Ctrl-C.

If you would rather use openPASO from Claude Code, Claude Desktop or
Cursor, you do not need this file at all. See "Start here" in README.md.
