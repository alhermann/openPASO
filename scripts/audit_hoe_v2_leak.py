"""Audit the HOE-v2 campaign for prompts that hand the agent the answer.

The v2 prompt set is the one the paper's numbers currently rest on.  This
script classifies every task by *how* it is compromised, if it is, and counts
the affected cells, so the finding is reproducible rather than asserted.

Three distinct defects, which matter differently:

``SOLUTION_STATED``
    the prompt writes out ``u_exact`` and then asks for the error against it.
    Any convergence order reported is not evidence that the agent solved the
    problem -- it is evidence that it can subtract.

``ANSWER_STATED``
    the prompt prints the numeric values the agent is asked to report, and the
    grading band is "within x% of" those same values.  Pure pattern-match.

``BENCHMARK_MEMORISABLE``
    no leak in the prompt, but the target is a famous published number
    (Ghia, Schaefer-Turek, Leissa, Roshko).  A model may recall it rather than
    compute it.  This is a weaker and different problem from a prompt leak and
    is reported separately so the two are not conflated.
