"""Does the software actually print the error message we quote?

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------------
Every verification agent that has executed knowledge rather than reading it has
come back with the same finding, and it is always the largest category:

    FEBio        25 invented error messages, 11 non-existent material names
    4C beams/contact/constraint   ~10 quoted diagnostics absent from the source
    NGSolve      "Newton did not converge after N iterations" — nowhere in
                 ngsolve/netgen; the real text is "Warning: Newton might not
                 converge! Error = "
    skfem        meshio "Cannot write complex array" — never emitted; the real
                 failure is KeyError: dtype('complex128')
    Kratos       FREESTREAM_VELOCITY / MACH_INFINITY — neither name exists
    scipy        "RuntimeError: matrix not positive definite" from cg — scipy
                 raises nothing at all; it returns info=1000 and a garbage
                 vector

Why this class is worse than a merely wrong entry: an agent uses the quoted
string to BUILD ITS GUARD. Told that cg raises, it writes an exception handler
and treats the absence of an exception as success — so the guard passes and the
garbage flows through. A fabricated diagnostic does not just fail to help; it
actively manufactures false confidence, which is the exact failure mode this
whole project exists to prevent.

The existing `audit_phantom_apis.py` checks API ATTRIBUTES via hasattr. It says
nothing about quoted message text, which is where the damage has actually been.

HOW THIS CHECKS
---------------
For each quoted fragment inside a `Signal:` clause, look for it in the software
that is supposed to emit it: the C++ source tree for compiled backends, the
installed package source for Python ones, and — importantly — their dependency
trees, because plenty of genuine messages come from Trilinos, PETSc, UMFPACK,
meshio or scipy rather than from the backend itself.

BUILT TO AVOID FALSE ACCUSATIONS, deliberately and at the cost of sensitivity.
Two earlier guards in this repo cried wolf: a delegation guard flagged `sorted`,
`dedent` and `format` as suspicious (~20 false accusations), and a disclosure
guard accused five honest 4C entries because it required a phrase verbatim that
the entries expressed slightly differently. A checker that is wrong often gets
ignored, and an ignored gate is worse than none — so this one:

  * searches dependency trees, not just the backend;
  * matches on the LONGEST STATIC FRAGMENT, since real messages interpolate at
    runtime ("DPoint 1 not in range [0:0[" is literal only in parts);
  * requires a fragment to be substantial before judging it at all;
  * reports UNKNOWN rather than ABSENT when it cannot see the source, because
    "I could not check" and "it is not there" are different claims and only one
    of them is an accusation.

Absence of a string from the source is strong evidence but not proof: messages
can be assembled from pieces, or come from a binary we cannot read. So the exit
status distinguishes "definitely absent" from "could not verify", and the report
says which is which.

    #   * applications that are real but not built here — PFEM2Application and

    """The same idea from the other end, because interpolation goes there too.

    `longest_found_prefix` assumes the runtime fills in the TAIL. Half the time
    it fills in the HEAD, and then a prefix search fails on its very first
    word. nanobind writes

        "<function name>(): incompatible function arguments"

    so the literal in dolfinx's cpp.abi3.so is `incompatible function
    arguments` and the quoted line starts with `create_matrix():`, which is in
    no binary because nanobind builds it from the bound signature. Searching
    only forwards reported both nanobind messages as fabricated — two more
    accusations against text captured from a live run.

    THE HEAD MUST LOOK LIKE AN INTERPOLATED VALUE, and without that condition
    this probe is actively harmful. A message's TAIL is often generic English,
    so an unconstrained suffix search excuses inventions wholesale. Measured on
    a deliberately fabricated set, it waved through three of ten:

        "ADIOS2 VTX only supports Lagrange elements"
                              <= "supports Lagrange elements"
        "cannot assemble: form has not been compiled"
                              <= "has not been compiled"
        "solver exploded during the quadrature loop"
                              <= "the quadrature loop"

    None of those three is emitted by anything; the tail merely reads like
    something that would be. A screen that excuses fabrications is worse than
    one that flags real text, because nobody investigates a pass.

    So the part being skipped has to be a single token — the shape of a name
    the runtime substitutes (`create_matrix():`, `__init__():`) — and not a
    run of prose. That keeps both nanobind messages and rejects all three
    inventions above.

    The last honest gap. Some messages are interpolated in the MIDDLE, so

    layout, where the real library sits in a `*.libs` SIBLING of the package

    the pybind11/nanobind wrapper

        envs/fenics/lib/libpetsc.so.3.24.5        29 MB

    Neither is a sibling of anything the old search could reach, so the audit
    searched the wrapper and answered for the library. The positive control is
    unambiguous — "Newton solver did not converge" is a stock dolfinx message:

        package dir      miss
        libdolfinx.so    HIT

    That single gap produced 10 false accusations in one FEniCSx run. All ten
    are stock PETSc or dolfinx text: `Zero pivot in LU factorization`,
    `SNES Function norm`, `MUMPS error in numerical factorization: INFOG(`,
    `SNESSolve has not converged`, `Degree of output Function must be same as
    mesh degree`. Every one of them was in the software the whole time, in a
    file the audit could not see. This is the FEBio symlink lesson in a
    different costume, and it is why a positive control has to run before any
    absence is quoted.

    Resolution is by DT_NEEDED rather than by globbing the env's lib/, which

    a search, it is a stall. The needed-list is what the backend is actually
    built on, so the corpus stays both correct and small (~80 MB for FEniCSx),
    and the transitive closure picks up the second rank — MUMPS reached
    through PETSc — which is where several genuine messages live.
