"""Two-phase blind grader: mesh-halving order first, sealed key second.

Wraps the campaign's existing ``grade_blind.py`` rather than replacing it — the
submission-integrity work in there (grader-owned probe grid, execution
evidence, non-finite rejection) is good and is reused as imported functions.

What this adds is the part the owner asked for and the existing grader does not
have:

    **PHASE 1 — no key.**  The observed convergence order is computed from the
    agent's own reported values across the refinement sequence, by Richardson
    mesh halving.  Needs no exact solution, so it runs immediately after a
    campaign, with the keys still sealed and the passphrase still not typed.

    **PHASE 2 — key.**  Optionally decrypts the sealed key in memory and
    computes the true error and the key-based order, exactly as before.

Running phase 1 alone is a real capability, not a fallback: it is the only
convergence evidence available for a problem with no closed form, which is the
situation every real engineering problem is in.  Running both and comparing is
strictly better than either — a disagreement means the sealed solution, the
problem statement, or the run is wrong, and that is a class of error neither
phase catches alone.

Usage:
    blind_grade.py <run_dir> <problem_id>              # phase 1 only
    blind_grade.py <run_dir> <problem_id> --with-key   # prompts for passphrase

# against question sheets whose probe count the grader rejects.
