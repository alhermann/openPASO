"""Key custody lifecycle for the blind campaign.

    commit      write the timestamped SHA-256 commitment into the repo
    verify      re-check key files against a committed manifest
    encrypt     AES-256-GCM the key files (passphrase typed, never stored)
    seal        chmod 000 the keys directory
    unseal      restore access for grading
    status      what state are the keys in right now
    preflight   every gate that must pass before a campaign may start

Order of operations for a campaign:

    1. blind_keys.py commit      -- hashes go into git BEFORE anything runs
    2. blind_keys.py encrypt     -- type the passphrase; it touches no disk
    3. blind_keys.py seal        -- keys become unreachable
    4. blind_keys.py preflight   -- refuses if any control is missing
    5. ... run the campaign ...
    6. blind_keys.py unseal      -- then grade with blind_grade.py --with-key

Step 1 comes first on purpose.  The commitment must be made while the keys are
still readable, and committing it before any run is what makes it evidence:
it proves the solutions were fixed in advance rather than derived after the
results were seen.

``verify`` is deliberately dependency-light (hashlib and json only) so a third
party can run it against a key file we hand them, without installing anything.
