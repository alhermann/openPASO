"""Rebuild the campaign-3 instances whose source term discloses the solution.

Three of the eleven pre-registered blind problems fail the leak gate:

    B1  one PRINTED source term is 12*pi**2 * u_exact  (naked-eye)
    D3  two/three printed terms sum to pi**2 * u_A and 4*pi**2 * u_B (naked-eye)
    B2  4*pi**2 * u_exact survives expansion (needs one expand(), not naked-eye)

``DESIGN.md`` admits B1 and D3 ("two instances leak by naked inspection") and
does not know about B2.  All three share one root cause:

    **the hidden field is an eigenfunction of the operator in at least one
    direction**, so applying the operator returns a multiple of the field
    itself, which then sits in the published source term.

``B1``/``B2`` use ``cos(2 pi x)`` / ``sin(pi x) sin(pi y)``; ``D3`` uses a
``sin(pi y)`` transverse profile, and ``-k d2/dy2`` of it is ``k pi^2`` times
itself.  The fix is therefore not cosmetic: replace the eigenfunction factors
with profiles that vanish on the boundary (so the boundary data still discloses
nothing) but are **not** eigenfunctions, so the operator maps them somewhere
else and the source term stops carrying a copy of the answer.

Physics, backend, element, mesh sequence, theoretical order and geometry are
all preserved, so the problem set keeps its intended shape.  Only the hidden
field changes.  Nothing is invalidated by this: the campaign has produced zero
runs.

Run:
    .venv/bin/python scripts/blind_rebuild_leaky.py [--apply]

Without ``--apply`` it verifies and reports, writing nothing.
