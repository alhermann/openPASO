"""Record which fixtures actually ran, passed, and were killed by their mutation.

THE NUMBER THIS EXISTS TO PRODUCE
---------------------------------
openPASO can say "1245 of 1377 knowledge warnings have a proof fixture" — 90%. Two
independent audits established what that sentence means: **a fixture exists**.
Not that it ran. Not that it passed.

The evidence of execution is `scripts/scan_results/tier2_results.json`, and it is
stale nearly everywhere:

    ofa-know-4c        116 recorded / 472 fixtures  (3 of them FAILED)
    ofa-verify-fenics  108 / 287
    ofa-verify-ngs     108 / 330
    ofa-know-febio     183 / 184     <- the only one doing this right

Three of four still hold the pre-campaign 108-fixture baseline. The cause is in
`docs/CONSOLIDATION.md`: the runner's `--write-results` flag was parsed and never
read during the campaigns, so every campaign's greenness lives in a session
transcript nobody can re-run.

So the two numbers a reviewer asks for first do not exist:

    N of <total> fixtures pass on commit X
    M of <controls> mutations go red

This produces both, per backend, with the commit sha and a timestamp.

WHY THE MUTATION HALF MATTERS AS MUCH AS THE PASS HALF
-----------------------------------------------------
A fixture greps stdout for strings it expects. Nothing in that mechanism can
tell a fixture that prints the right strings for the right reason from one that
prints them for the wrong reason — a script hardcoding its own expected output
passes identically. The mutation control is the whole difference: remove the
pathology, and the fixture must go red.

So a fixture that passes BOTH mutated and unmutated proves nothing, and finding
those is the most valuable output here. They are reported, never repaired — a
red row with a diagnosis is worth more than a green one somebody engineered.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It does not judge whether a fixture asserts the RIGHT thing. It cannot. Recent
passes found a DUNE fixture printing `zero_pressure_entry_claim_not_reproduced`
when the claim IS reproduced (its mask sliced the wrong leg of an interpolation),
and a skfem fixture printing `free_boundary_leaves_zero_immediately=True` while
its own next line printed `max_over_run=0.0` — because `np.argmax` returns 0 on
an all-False array. Both pass. Both would be killed by their mutation, because
the mutation flips the assertion either way. Only a person re-reading the probe
catches that class, and pretending otherwise would be the same error one level
up from the one this project exists to fix.
