"""The campaign itself must be pre-registered, not merely declared to be.

``campaign3_blind`` was not under version control.  A frozen, pre-registered
design that can be silently edited is not pre-registered, and once results exist
there is no way to show afterwards that the grader which graded is the grader
that was designed.  That is the first thing a hostile referee asks, it is
answerable in an hour now, and never afterwards.

Three commands:

    sync        copy the version-controlled campaign into the live directory and
                verify byte equality afterwards
    commit      hash the campaign state -- design, runner, grader, phase gate,
                builder, every task text and public spec -- plus the legacy
                plaintext builders, into a timestamped manifest that goes into
                git BEFORE any run
    verify      re-check the live directory against the committed manifest

Why the legacy builders are hashed rather than committed
--------------------------------------------------------
``build_problems.py`` and ``build_extra.py`` hold every hidden field for B1-B7
as a Python literal, so they cannot go into a repository.  But "cannot be
committed" must not mean "can be silently changed": their SHA-256 goes into the
manifest, so an edit is detectable without the content ever being published.
``build_coupled_v2.py`` needs neither treatment -- it holds no solution, because
the fields are drawn from a CSPRNG at build time and only the seed reaches the
sealed key.
