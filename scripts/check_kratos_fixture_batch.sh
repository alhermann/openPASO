#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Last step of EVERY tier-2 fixture batch. Not optional, and not replaceable by
# checking the fixtures you just wrote.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Fixtures here are produced by throwaway generator scripts. A generator writes
# a whole batch. If you later find a defect in ONE fixture and correct it in a
# follow-up script, then edit and re-run the ORIGINAL generator to change a
# DIFFERENT fixture in the same batch, the correction is silently overwritten by
# the superseded version — and it gets committed in that state.
#
# That happened. poisson_convectiondiffusionsettings_on_processinfo was
# corrected in a follow-up script, then reverted by a re-run of the batch
# generator, and committed failing. Every fixture in that batch passed when it
# was written, so per-fixture verification could not see it. Only running the
# COMPLETE set caught it.
#
# The rule: verify the whole set, not the diff.
#
# Usage:
#   KRATOS_PYTHON=/path/to/python scripts/check_kratos_fixture_batch.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if any kratos fixture fails other than the two known
# host-path-dependent ones (see KNOWN_HOST_PATH below).
