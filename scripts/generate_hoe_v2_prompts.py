### Fabrication audit (applies to every cell)

A cell passes only if, in addition to the numeric gates:
1. the cell's work dir contains the runnable script(s) and genuine solver
   output artifacts (VTU/XDMF/logs/control files) that produce the reported
   numbers, and
2. the reported values match what those artifacts/scripts actually yield.

For tasks whose reference values are famous and likely memorized from the
literature (B3, B4, E5, E6, E8), additionally re-run one stored script per
task during grading and confirm it reproduces the result.txt values.
Values that cannot be traced to an actual run are graded FAIL with
failure_code = fabricated, regardless of numeric correctness.

| Task | Gate |
|------|------|

| B5 | consensus plausibility; max pressure amplification in [1, 3]; peak near 0 deg / 180 deg |

def preamble(commit, branch, n_cells):
    return f"""# HOE-v2 Manual Prompts ({n_cells} cells)

Repo: `{BASE}` — branch `{branch}`, commit `{commit}`.

**Scope.** Full rerun of the 17 HOE-v1 tasks plus 8 new Tier-E tasks
(adversarial / cross-code / research-level), under the three MCP conditions
only (no BARE in v2): {n_cells} cells = 25 tasks x 3 conditions x 3 seeds.

## Conditions

| Condition | Env var before `claude` | What is masked |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| MCP_FULL | (none) | nothing |
| MCP_NO_PITFALL_DB | `export OFA_DISABLE_PITFALLS=1` | per-backend pitfalls incl. Signal anchors, post-mortems, cross-backend collation catalog, general input-format pitfalls |
| MCP_NO_CRITIC | `export OFA_DISABLE_CRITIC=1` | MANDATORY CRITIC paragraph in server instructions |

Each fresh `claude` session spawns its own MCP-server process, so the
exported variable propagates to the server. Never run two conditions in the
same terminal.

## Pre-flight (run once before the campaign, and after any server change)

```bash
cd {BASE}
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_hoe_ablation.py   # must print three "ok" lines
.venv/bin/pytest -q                               # 499 passed expected
```

Note: failures in `tests/test_signal_verification.py::TestBackendImportSnapshot`
are expected on this machine (snapshots reference dev-machine library paths,
e.g. `~/Schreibtisch/dealii-debug/`); they are environment drift, not server
defects. The `.venv` was repaired on 2026-06-12 (re-pointed to the local
cpython-3.12.13 copy after a snap revision GC broke the old symlinks).

## How to use

For each cell below:
1. Open a fresh terminal.
2. Paste the cell's bash block (it does the `cd`, the export if any, and starts `claude`).
3. Paste the prompt block into claude.
4. Wait for completion. The result.txt lands at the path embedded in the prompt.
5. Close the terminal. Next cell.

Workdirs carry a `_v2` suffix (`eval_interactive/<TASK>_<COND>_seed<N>_v2/work/`)
so v1 artefacts are never overwritten. Grading bands are in the appendix at
the end of this file.
