"""
Tier-2 fixture runner — operationally verify Signal: clauses.

Each fixture is a directory under
``scripts/tier2_fixtures/<backend>/<id>/`` containing:

  * ``fixture.json`` — metadata: target backend, physics name,
    pitfall_index it verifies, the Signal substring or regex
    that the captured output must contain, and how to run the
    fixture (compile_only / compile_and_run / python).
  * ``source.cpp`` / ``source.py`` — the intentional-failure
    code. Compiling and/or running it must produce output that
    matches the Signal.
  * Optional ``cmd.sh`` for shell-level fixtures.

The runner:
  1. Walks every fixture under scripts/tier2_fixtures/
  2. Executes per the fixture's ``mode``
  3. Captures stderr + stdout
  4. Checks the captured text against the fixture's
     ``expect_in_output`` (substring; case-insensitive) and
     ``forbid_in_output`` lists.
  5. Writes a row to ``scripts/scan_results/tier2_results.json``
     keyed ``<backend>::<physics>::<pitfall_index>``.

The verify_signal_clauses.py harness reads that JSON; the
test_signal_verification.py merge gate enforces non-regression
on Tier-2 pass counts as well.

Senior-AI-scientist critic (2026-05-31 round 2) called Tier-2
the actual top risk after the Tier-0+1 fix — "every encoded
pitfall is a claim the project cannot defend without
operational verification". This runner exists so the project
CAN defend, one fixture at a time.
