"""Shared machinery for the COUPLING tier-2 fixtures.

Why these fixtures exist
------------------------
The tier-2 suite had 108 fixtures and not one of them exercised coupling. Every
one was single-code. Coupling is the capability the project leans on hardest —
it is the thing a model without openPASO cannot do at all — and its knowledge was
~35 kB across 18 per-backend payloads with no fixture-level verification behind
any of it.

What a coupling fixture must do, and what it must not
-----------------------------------------------------
It runs a REAL two-code coupling through the REGISTERED `couple` tool (the same
one an agent calls, reached through the same FastMCP tool manager the server
uses — not `run_coupling` directly, because `couple`'s own argument handling and
validation block are part of what the knowledge claims) and then checks the
PHYSICS against a closed form.

Checking `converged` is NOT enough and that is the whole point: a partitioned
fixed-point scheme converges to a fixed point, which is only the solution if the
two participants exchange the right quantity with the right sign in the right
units. A unit mismatch converges beautifully, balances to roundoff, and passes
every check the driver has. So each fixture asserts the interface VALUE, the
interface FLUX and the flux BALANCE against the analytic answer for the
placeholder problem.

No measured number from these runs is written into the knowledge text, and no
fixture pins one: every threshold here is a tolerance the physics must beat, and
the errors are PRINTED so the run reports its own numbers.

Absent backends
---------------
A fixture must not pass on a machine that cannot run it. Every entry point here
raises `Absent` when a required backend is missing, and `main()` turns that into
a `FAIL:` line plus a non-zero exit. `FAIL:` is in every coupling fixture's
`forbid_in_output`, and the expectations name substantive values (an error
magnitude, an iteration count) that are printed only on the path that really
ran. So a host without FEniCSx reports a FAILURE, never a pass.

# ── the VECTOR problem: plane-strain elasticity, displacement AND traction ──
#
# Everything above exchanges ONE SCALAR across the interface. This exchanges a
# two-component displacement and a two-component traction, in both directions,
# which is the primitive every multiphysics coupling (TSI, FSI, contact) is
# built on and the thing a scalar fixture cannot establish.
#
# The problem is a plane-strain bimaterial strip [xl, xr] x [y0, y1] split at
# x = xi, with a PRESCRIBED DISPLACEMENT on the whole outer boundary (the two
# outer x-faces and both y-faces) taken from a field that is piecewise linear
# in (x, y):
#
#     u_x = a_i (x - x_i0) + c_i + p y        a_i, b_i per block
#     u_y = b_i (x - x_i0) + d_i + r y        p, r global
#
# Strains are constant in each block, so sigma is constant in each block, so
# div sigma = 0 and the field is an exact solution. Continuity of u and of
# sigma . e_x across x = xi fixes a_i, b_i from the totals (dux, duy) and the
# two global gradients (p, r). P1/Q1 reproduce it EXACTLY — it is a patch test
# — so the only error left in a converged coupling is the coupling itself, and
# the tolerances can be tight enough that a wrong Poisson ratio cannot hide.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES THIS IS BUILT FOR, none of which the scalar problem has:
#
#   * BOTH COMPONENTS ARE ALIVE. u_x, u_y, t_x and t_y are all non-zero at the
#     interface, so a coupling that drops or scrambles a component is visible.
#   * THE INTERFACE STATE VARIES ALONG THE INTERFACE. p and r make u_x and u_y
#     linear in y on the interface, so a mapping between two non-matching
#     interface meshes has something to get wrong. With a constant profile,
#     ANY mapping — including one that interleaves the components — reproduces
#     it, and the non-matching-mesh claim would be vacuous.
#   * THE Y-FACES ARE PRESCRIBED, NOT TRACTION-FREE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
#     With traction-free y-faces each block can BEND, the bending compliance
#     scales as L^3 against L^1 for the axial one, and the Steklov spectrum of
#     the two-subdomain iteration opens up to [0.049, 2.07] — measured. The
#     single theta the driver applies then converges the x component while
#     DIVERGING the y one: measured here, theta = 1/(1+rho_x) with the y-faces
#     free left u_x settling on the exact answer while u_y oscillated with
#     growing amplitude, and the run reported only "did not converge". Clamping
#     the y-faces removes the bending modes; the spectrum tightens to
#     [0.25, 0.64], mesh-independently, and one theta serves both components.
#     This is a real property of vector coupling, not a detail: see
#     vector_relaxation_needs_the_worst_component.

#
# These fixtures solve coupled problems for real, so every directory this
# creates holds a WORKED ANSWER. The blind campaign's custody preflight refuses
# to launch a round while any readable one exists in the shared /tmp -- and it
# checks ONCE, at launch, against a condition that is not stable for the next
# 45 minutes.
#
# Measured on 2026-09-16, and the ordering is the whole point: a
# `run_tier2_fixtures.py --write-results` regeneration started at 14:20 was
# still creating these at 15:03, while the campaign session was reading the
# listing and attributing them to its own regression suite. Nothing warned
# either of us. A fixture suite has no reason to think it is dangerous, and a
# gate at t=0 cannot see what appears at t+40min.
#
# So the default moves off the shared /tmp. T2_COUPLING_WORKROOT overrides it,
# then TMPDIR; the fallback is a directory beside this repo, which is private to
# whoever checked it out and is gitignored.
#
# ONE WARNING ABOUT TMPDIR ON THIS PROJECT'S HARDWARE: pointing it at the
# exFAT PortableSSD has broken fixtures before -- no symlinks, no permission
# bits, and nine 4C fixtures failed for that reason alone. If you set either
# variable, set it to a real filesystem. Nothing here seals or deletes: that is the campaign's
# business and its preflight still decides. This only stops the fixtures from
# writing into the one place two sessions share.

    `deviation` rather than the raw magnitude, and that choice matters. The

    iteration from a runaway one at a bearable iteration budget.

    The residual is not that discriminator either: it is normalised by the raw
    export magnitude, so a diverging run SATURATES it near a constant of order

# ── the MONOLITHIC reference: the same problem solved un-split, in one code ─
#
# Every pair fixture already checks the converged interface state against the
# closed form. That is an independent answer, but it is an independent FORMULA:
# it shares an author with the fixture, and if the formula were wrong every pair
# fixture would agree with it in unison. So the harness also solves the WHOLE
# rectangle as ONE problem — no interface, no partitioning, no driver — and
# compares against that.
#
# Two properties this deliberately has:
#   * it is COMPUTED HERE, in the fixture harness, never served. An agent cannot
#     reach it through any tool, so it cannot be quoted back as an answer;
#   * it is a different KIND of evidence. The closed form assumes the solution is
#     piecewise linear in x with no y-variation; the monolithic solve assumes
#     nothing and would disagree if that were wrong.
#
# The monolithic flux is taken from the LEFT DIRICHLET BOUNDARY REACTION rather
# than from a gradient at the interface. In steady conduction with no source the
# heat crossing every vertical section is the same, so the boundary reaction IS
# the interface flux — and a reaction needs no differentiation of the discrete
# solution, which is what makes it accurate enough to be a reference at all.
