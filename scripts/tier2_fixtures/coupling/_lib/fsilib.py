"""FSI arrangements for the tier-2 coupling fixtures.

Sits next to couplinglib and reuses its plumbing (`couple`, `check`, `close`,
`main`, `interpreter`, `edit`, `Absent`). What is here is only the FSI-specific
staging and the FSI-specific interface checks.

THE CASE. A rigid-walled 2-D channel whose TOP wall is a thin elastic plate
clamped at both ends. Incompressible Navier-Stokes below, plane-strain linear
elasticity above, a straight interface between them. The fluid gives the
structure a traction; the structure gives the fluid a boundary displacement,
which moves the fluid mesh (ALE) and so changes the flow. Both directions carry
physics, and the fixtures prove it by switching each one off.

WHY THIS CASE AND NOT A FLAPPING FLAG. Every quantity in it has an independent
handle. On the undeformed configuration the fluid problem is plane Poiseuille,
so the interface force the fluid computes is 12*mu*U*L/H^2 * L/2 in the normal
direction and 6*mu*U/H * L in the tangential one, and the structure's response
to that load is a clamped-clamped beam. Neither closed form is the coupled
answer — the coupling moves both — but a participant that is wrong by an order
of magnitude, a unit, or a sign cannot pass through them on the way in.
