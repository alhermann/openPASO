"""Shared machinery for the TWO-WAY thermo-structural (TSI) coupling fixtures.

WHAT MAKES A TSI FIXTURE DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT ONES
-----------------------------------------------------
The existing coupling fixtures are DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION: two subdomains, one
scalar field, a shared interface, Dirichlet on one side and Neumann on the
other. TSI is a FIELD coupling — the two participants occupy the SAME body and
exchange volume fields, temperature one way and volumetric strain the other.
Nothing about the interface machinery applies: there is no flux to balance
across, no normal to get the sign of, and `couple`'s conservation checks report
themselves as not-run rather than passing.

So the verification has to come from somewhere else, and the whole point of
these fixtures is that it does:

  1. CONVERGENCE, with a relaxation that is actually needed. At the exaggerated
     coupling strength the un-relaxed Jacobi iteration DIVERGES (the composite
     map's eigenvalues are +-i*sqrt(delta) and delta > 1), so a converged run is
     not free.
  2. AGREEMENT WITH A MONOLITHIC RE-SOLVE of the same problem — one mesh, one
     assembly, no exchange, no iteration (see tsi_monolithic.py).
  3. BOTH DIRECTIONS ACTIVE, and this is the one that matters. A "two-way"
     coupling whose reverse direction changes nothing is one-way with extra
     steps. Two independent demonstrations, and the second is the real one:
       (a) suppressing mechanical -> thermal MOVES the answer, by a margin
           reported next to the tolerance the agreement check uses;
       (b) the suppressed run then matches the ONE-WAY monolithic reference,
           which was computed independently. So the reverse direction does not
           merely perturb the answer, it moves it BY THE RIGHT AMOUNT — a
           coupling that exchanged the wrong quantity would also move when
           switched off, and would land somewhere else.
  4. A MUTATION CONTROL, in each fixture.json, that perturbs the physics and
     makes the checks fail.

HOW THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE SWITCHED OFF, and why it is done through the tool.
`imports_from` is enough for both, so no participant script has to be edited to
run the controls:
  * thermal with `imports_from=[]` falls back to EVOL_INIT, which is set to the
    volumetric strain of the initial state, so the (e - e_old) source term is
    identically zero. That is EXACTLY the one-way problem.
  * mech with `imports_from=[]` falls back to THETA_INIT, a uniform temperature,
    so the structure no longer sees the thermal field.
The thermal participant ALSO carries a `COUPLING` switch, and the fixtures check
that the two routes agree — a cross-check on both.

NO MEASURED NUMBER FROM THESE RUNS IS WRITTEN INTO ANY SERVED TEXT, and no
fixture pins one: every threshold here is a tolerance the physics must beat, and
the errors are PRINTED so each run reports its own numbers.
