"""The conservation check has to fire on a wrong interface and stay silent on a
right one. Both directions, because only one of them is usually tested.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST, from the interface-flux section of the coupling knowledge:

  "That is what openPASO's conservation check tests. Export both sides with the
   same sign and a CORRECT coupling fails it ... a genuinely near-zero net flux
   (a symmetric profile) is NOT reported as unbalanced — the comparison is
   floored by the flux magnitudes, so float noise on two cancelling integrals
   cannot manufacture a failure."

  "if EITHER side omits `normal_fluxes` it reports `Interface conservation was
   NOT CHECKED` rather than passing silently."

A validator is two claims, and the second one is the one that rots. Everybody
tests that a detector fires. Almost nobody tests that it stays quiet, and a
detector that cries wolf is worse than none: it trains the reader to skip the
line where the real finding will appear. The specific case that motivated this
is a FRICTIONLESS contact interface — the normal tractions cancel exactly and
the tangential ones are two different roundoff crumbs — which a per-component
comparison without a magnitude floor reports as ~92% unbalanced on a physically
perfect interface.

This fixture is pure arithmetic on hand-built exports: no solver, no coupling,
and therefore no way for a slow backend to hide a regression in the validator.
