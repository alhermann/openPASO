"""The coupling failure table is only worth its size if a broken run can REACH
it, and until now nothing could.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. Every other family of knowledge in openPASO ships its
symptoms as `[Category] ... Signal: ...` entries, and `knowledge(signal=...)` is
how a post-execution critic gets from a symptom to the entry that explains it.
The coupling payload had a failure table whose left-hand column IS a set of
signals — and no pitfall list, no `Signal:` shape and no search. A coupling
failure could not be routed to the rows that name it: the reader had to already
know to ask for `topic='coupling'` and then read the whole payload.

WHERE THE QUERIES BELOW CAME FROM, because that is what makes them evidence.
They are NOT the entry author's phrasings. A hostile third party was given the
search and no sight of the entries, wrote a hundred queries from its own idea of
how a partitioned coupling goes wrong, and only then read the table to judge
each result. The first version of the router scored ~62% recall and ~52% top-1
against that set: it divided by the query length, so `nan` found the right entry
and `solver crashed with nan after the third coupling step` found nothing; it
weighted every token alike, so `interface` and `step` decided rankings; and its
entries spoke thermal while half the queries spoke mechanics, so every
force / load / traction / mapping phrasing missed. The queries kept here are
that party's, including the ones it phrased with typos, and they are a
REGRESSION SET: they are the evidence that those three faults are fixed, not
evidence that the router generalises to a NEXT party's vocabulary.

AND A SECOND BLIND PARTY WAS THEN RUN, because the paragraph above is only worth
something if it is acted on. It wrote ninety-five fresh queries without seeing
any of this, and measured 60% recall and 53% top-1 — that is, most of the gain
the first party's queries had shown was fitted to the first party's vocabulary,
exactly as this file predicted. It found two more structural faults, both fixed:
an unrecognised word was scored at the MAXIMUM weight in the coverage
denominator, so a longer query was punished after all ("handshake" returned four
rows, "handshake never completes" returned none); and the synonym table was
keyed on stems the stemmer never produces, so `wobble` could not reach the entry
`wobbles` reached. Its queries for the classes that then still missed are in the
set below too.

THE HONEST STATE, because two blind passes is still not a claim of generality.
The rows below reach a much wider vocabulary than they did, and there remain
whole failure families the TABLE has no row for at all — staggering lag,
subcycling, checkpoint and restart, mapping quality, a discontinuity in the
transferred VALUE rather than the flux — and a query about one of those gets a
confidently wrong neighbour rather than a refusal. That is a content gap, not a
matcher gap, and it is not fixed here.

WHAT THIS FIXTURE CHECKS, all through the REGISTERED `knowledge` tool:
  1. NO DRIFT. The markdown table and the searchable entries are generated from
     one list, every row appears in both, and each marker below identifies
     exactly one entry.
  2. ROUTING FROM AN OBSERVATION. Every query describes what somebody SAW, with
     no mechanism in it — no "theta", no "sign convention", no "units". A query
     that names the cause proves nothing: the entry contains the cause, so of
     course it matches, and the person with the problem does not know the cause
     yet.
  3. DISCRIMINATION. Queries about single-code problems, installation, licences
     and linear solvers must be REFUSED. A matcher that answers everything has
     routed nothing, and the first version answered a preconditioner question
     with five coupling entries.
