"""FSI through the generic `couple` path: cross-code, same-code, and the two
one-way controls that prove both directions carry physics.

WHAT THIS FIXTURE ESTABLISHES, and nothing beyond it:

  1. a partitioned fluid-structure interaction runs end to end through the
     public `couple` tool, with the fluid in FEniCSx and the structure in
     scikit-fem — two different codes under two different interpreters;
  2. the same coupling with the structure ALSO in FEniCSx lands on the same
     interface displacement, so the answer is not an artefact of one structure
     code;
  3. the converged answer is the ROOT of the coupled system, not merely a place
     the iteration stopped: a Newton-Krylov re-solve of the same coupled
     interface equation is handed to `couple(monolithic=)` and agrees;
  4. BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE ACTIVE. Suppressing structure->fluid (the fluid stops
     moving its mesh) changes the converged deflection by a measured amount well
     outside every tolerance here, and `couple`'s own responsiveness and
     interface-sensitivity checks catch the suppression unprompted. Suppressing
     fluid->structure collapses the deflection to zero and breaks the interface
     force balance. A one-way coupling could not produce (4).
  5. interface equilibrium and kinematic continuity hold COMPONENTWISE across
     two non-matching interface discretisations.

WHAT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH. The Newton-Krylov reference drives the same
participant scripts, so it cannot see a bug inside a participant — both would
be wrong identically. The closed-form handles below are what stands in for that
on the fluid and structure separately, and an independent-code FSI reference is
what stands in for it on the coupled problem.
