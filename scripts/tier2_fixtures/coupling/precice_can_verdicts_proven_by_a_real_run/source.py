"""The preCICE "CAN" side, proven by a real two-participant coupled run.

WHICH OF THE TWO FIXTURES THIS IS, AND WHY
------------------------------------------
This is the STRONG one: a REAL preCICE coupling, driven through the REGISTERED
`couple_precice` tool, between two backends that live in two DIFFERENT
interpreters — scikit-fem in the openPASO venv and FEniCSx in its own conda env —
with the exchanged interface fields checked against a closed form. The weaker
fallback (prove only the import gate) was not needed, so the import gate is
folded in as this fixture's PRECONDITION rather than as its whole content: the
gate is what decides whether a backend can use `couple_precice` at all, and
`_PRECICE_CORE` states it in a form nothing else tests.

THE CLAIMS UNDER TEST
---------------------
From `knowledge(topic='precice', solver=...)`:

  scikit-fem: "CAN — proven by a real coupled run ... `import precice` works in
              the interpreter that carries scikit-fem, and a scikit-fem
              participant was coupled to a second code end to end."
  FEniCSx:    "CAN — proven by a real coupled run ... `import precice` works in
              the same interpreter as `dolfinx` ... You do NOT need
              `fenicsprecice`."
  NGSolve:    "CAN — ... `import precice` works in the interpreter that carries
              NGSolve." (the GATE only; NGSolve shares the venv with
              scikit-fem, so it is named in the same probe rather than left to
              scikit-fem's result standing in for it. The NGSolve payload's own
              two silent-wrong traps are not what this fixture is about.)
  DUNE-fem:   "put the site-packages of the interpreter that HAS `pyprecice` on
              `PYTHONPATH` and the preCICE lib on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and the
              DUNE interpreter imports both."

From `_PRECICE_CORE`:

  "`libprecice` must be loadable, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is NOT optional:
   without it `import precice` fails with `libprecice.so.3: cannot open shared
   object file`."
  "every participant must be able to `import precice` (or link libprecice) IN
   ITS OWN INTERPRETER. That is the gate."
  "`converged` in the returned JSON is EXIT CODES plus preCICE's own per-window
   verdict ... It is still not a check on the VALUES."

WHY CHECKING `converged` WOULD NOT BE A TEST
--------------------------------------------
The knowledge says outright that `converged` never looks at the exchanged
fields, and the fixture's own mutation demonstrates the consequence: flip the
sign with which the Neumann participant applies the incoming flux and the run
still exits 0 on both sides, preCICE still logs "All converged", and the
coupling still reaches a fixed point — a DIFFERENT one, ~22 K away from the
right answer, with both sides exporting the SAME sign of flux so nothing is
conserved across the interface. Every signal `couple_precice` returns stays
green. So this fixture asserts the VALUES: the interface temperature from both
sides, the interface flux density from both sides with the two outward normals'
opposite signs, the flux balance, and the absence of y-variation the exact
solution forbids — each against a closed form computed here, not against a
number recorded from a previous run.

THE PLACEHOLDER PROBLEM AND ITS CLOSED FORM
-------------------------------------------
Steady conduction with no source on a rectangle split at x = XI. No
y-variation, so the exact solution is piecewise linear in x, the interface
temperature is the conductance-weighted mean of the two outer Dirichlet values
and the interface flux follows from either side. "Conductance" is k divided by
the distance from the interface to that subdomain's own outer boundary. The two
subdomains are meshed INDEPENDENTLY and do not match at the interface (16
points against 12 here), which is the case preCICE's mapping exists for.
