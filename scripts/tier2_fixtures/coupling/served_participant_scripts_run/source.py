"""The nine participant scripts, taken out of what the TOOL returns, and run.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. `knowledge(topic='coupling')` ends with a section headed
"PER-BACKEND PARTICIPANT SCRIPTS — one call each, complete and runnable", and
each per-backend payload hands over a script under "COMPLETE PARTICIPANT SCRIPT
— copy verbatim, edit the marked block only". The module that serves them says
why they are files rather than string literals: "the file is the artefact that
gets executed in the test suite, so the text an agent is served and the text
that was proven to run cannot drift apart."

That reasoning is only sound if something actually executes the SERVED text. A
test that reads `data/coupling_participants/participant_x.py` off disk proves
the file runs; it proves nothing about what the tool returns, and the two are
separated by an extraction function, a payload template and nine call sites. So
this fixture goes through the registered `knowledge` tool, cuts the script out
of the fenced block in the reply, and runs THAT.

It also checks the launch text, because that is where the drift actually
happened. Four `.replace()` calls were meant to tell the four WRAPPER backends —
4C, FEBio, SPARTA, deal.II — that `command` runs a Python wrapper and the solver
binary goes into a constant inside the script. All four were silent no-ops: the
literals they searched for wrapped their lines at a different point than the
text did, so every wrapper backend served the generic "get the interpreter from
discover(query='list')" instead, and an agent following it verbatim would put a
compiled solver binary where a Python interpreter belongs. `str.replace` cannot
fail, so nothing reported it for as long as it was wrong.
