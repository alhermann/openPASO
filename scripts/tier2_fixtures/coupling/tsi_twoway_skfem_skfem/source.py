"""TWO-WAY TSI, same code on both halves — the control the cross-code pairs are
read against.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST: openPASO can run a genuinely two-way thermo-structural
coupling through the generic `couple` path — thermal expansion drives the
deformation AND the deformation feeds back into the energy equation — and the
converged answer is the answer, not just A fixed point.

Both halves are scikit-fem here on purpose. A cross-code pair that disagrees
with the monolithic reference leaves two suspects: the coupling, and the second
code. This one removes the second, so it is the fixture that says whether the
COUPLING is right. The cross-code pairs then say whether it survives crossing a
code boundary.

WHAT IT RUNS, in order:
  * the exaggerated-coupling problem (delta ~ 1.25), where the un-relaxed
    iteration diverges and the reverse direction moves the answer by ~10%;
  * the same problem with the reverse direction switched off THROUGH THE
    COUPLING GRAPH (`imports_from=[]` on the thermal side), checked against the
    one-way monolithic reference;
  * the same suppression through the participant's own `COUPLING` switch, to
    check the two routes agree;
  * a real metal's coupling strength (delta ~ 0.012), where the reverse
    direction is a fraction of a percent — small, but still four orders of
    magnitude above the agreement tolerance, and the fixture reports the
    margin rather than asserting the effect is "large".
