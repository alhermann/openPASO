"""Tier-2 Layer-F: catalog generator templates execute end-to-end.

Layer B verified `generate_input` doesn't raise on the
catalog. Layer C verified our MMS RE-IMPLEMENTATION of
the catalog's API converges. This is the missing piece:
take the catalog's ACTUAL emitted template, write it to
a tempfile, run it through the backend's interpreter,
and assert the run succeeds + emits expected sentinels.

This is what an LLM agent actually does: ask the MCP
for a template, save it, and run it. If the catalog
ships a template that the LLM-emit-and-run loop can't
execute, every other layer in the matrix could pass and
the user still gets a broken script.

Approach: per backend in {skfem, kratos} (both run
quickly in the repo .venv), for the simplest physics
(poisson 2d), call generate_input via the live
registry, write to a tempfile in /tmp, exec it via the
ACTUAL python interpreter the runner uses, and assert
exit_code == 0 + no Traceback. NGSolve/fenics need
their own conda envs and would slow this down to 30+
seconds per backend — keep this gate fast.

# 2026-08-07: this used to be two hard-coded assumptions, and both had gone
# stale in the way that produces a SKIP rather than an error — the least
# visible failure this fixture can have, because a skipped row is not a
# failure and a reader cannot tell it from "that backend is not installed".
#
#   * fenics was looked for at ~/miniconda3/envs/ofa-fenicsx. On this host the
#     dolfinx env is called `fenics` (plus `fenicsc` for complex scalars), so
#     ALL 35 fenics rows printed "SKIPPED (no env)" and the fixture certified
#     nothing about a third of the catalog it claims to cover.
#   * skfem, kratos and ngsolve were all handed sys.executable on the comment
#     "Repo .venv has scikit-fem 12 + KratosMultiphysics + NGSolve installed".
