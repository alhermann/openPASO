# Tier-2 for dealii advection_dg#0 -- probe "cell_only_sparsity" of the shared DG
# translation unit _shared/dgip_family.cc, compiled once per build type and cached
# so every fixture that names a probe of that unit shares ONE C++ build.
#
# Upwind FE_DGQ(1) advection on a globally refined unit square, assembled into a
# matrix whose pattern came from DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern instead of
# make_flux_sparsity_pattern. Both patterns are built for the same DoFHandler in
# every run, so the entry's cheap positive check is measured rather than
# asserted: 4608 against 1024 non-zeros, a ratio of 4.5. A dry run over the
# interior faces then counts 3584 entries the assembly wants that the cell-only
# pattern does not have.
#
# WHAT HAPPENS NEXT DEPENDS ON THE BUILD TYPE, so both run here:
#   Release  rc=0. The Assert in SparseMatrix::add is compiled out, the face
#            contributions are SILENTLY DROPPED, "after_face_assembly" is
#            reached, and the answer is O(1) wrong (max difference 1.18 on a
#            field of amplitude 1.18).
#   Debug    rc=134, an ABORT from sparse_matrix.templates.h with the violated
#            condition "value == number()" and the message "You are trying to
#            access the matrix entry with index <4,1>, but this entry does not
#            exist in the sparsity pattern of this matrix" --
#            "after_face_assembly" is never reached.
# Neither build raises anything a try/catch could see; the Debug path is an
# abort, which is why this fixture asserts on the exit code.
#
# The two greps check the two exception strings this entry and dg_transport::0
# used to promise. Neither string is in any header or source of this tree.
#
# Mutation control: T2_MUTATE=1 makes the probe use
# DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern, and the fixture then fails its own
# expectations.
