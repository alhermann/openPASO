# Tier-2 for dealii hp_adaptive#1 — probe "fe_index_past_collection" of the
# shared hp translation unit _shared/hp_family.cc, compiled once and cached so
# seven fixtures share one build.
#
# The entry's own shape: a 2-entry hp::FECollection with one cell set to
# active_fe_index 5, then distribute_dofs(). The two build types answer
# completely differently, and the Release answer is the dangerous one:
#   Release  SIGSEGV, rc=139, no output after "before_distribute_dofs" —
#            no exception, and no chance to read n_dofs() == 0 either
#   Debug    Assert ABORT, rc=134, from source/dofs/dof_handler.cc with the
#            violated condition cell->active_fe_index() < ff.size() and the
#            message "The mesh contains a cell with an active FE index of 5, but
#            the finite element collection only has 2 elements"
# That Assert is in the COMPILED library, so -DDEBUG on the consumer cannot
# bring it back — only the Debug library can, which is why this fixture sets
# requires_debug and runs both.
#
# The grep below checks the entry's other statement: the ExcMessage it used to
# promise, "Index in FECollection out of range", is in no header of this tree.
#
# Mutation control: T2_MUTATE=1 uses index 1, inside the collection, and both
# builds then return normally with rc=0, so the fixture fails its expectations.
