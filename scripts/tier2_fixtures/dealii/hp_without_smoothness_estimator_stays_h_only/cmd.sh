# Tier-2 for dealii hp_adaptive#3 — probe "no_smoothness_estimator" of the
# shared hp translation unit _shared/hp_family.cc, compiled once and cached so
# seven fixtures share one build.
#
# Eight adaptive cycles on a SMOOTH manufactured solution
# (u = sin(pi x) sin(pi y), zero Dirichlet), run twice in one process: once with
# the FESeries::Legendre object driving p-adaptivity, once without it. Without
# it there is no p-decision to make, every cell stays at FE_Q(1), and the
# L2 error against the analytic solution falls with the plain h-rate.
#
# The entry names a function "p_adaptivity_from_smoothness" that silently falls
# back to uniform refinement. No such symbol exists in this library — the grep
# below lists what hp::Refinement actually offers — so the pitfall is the
# absence of the estimator, not a fallback inside it.

# MUTATION CONTROL (see fixture.json). _shared/hp_family.cc reads T2_MUTATE and,
# when it is 1, gives the run UNDER TEST the FESeries::Legendre smoothness
# estimator that this fixture's whole claim is about not having. Exporting it
# here (defaulting to 0) is what lets the recipe in fixture.json turn the
# control permanently on without touching the shared translation unit.
