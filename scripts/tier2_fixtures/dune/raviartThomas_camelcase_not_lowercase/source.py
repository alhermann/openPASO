"""Tier-2: DUNE raviartThomas is camelCase, not lowercase.

The catalog had:

  src/backends/dune/generators/advanced.py L592, L608:
    from dune.fem.space import raviartthomas, dglagrange
    Sigma = raviartthomas(gridView, order=order)
  src/backends/dune/generators/__init__.py L40:
    "raviartthomas": "H(div) conforming"

The real DUNE function is raviartThomas (camelCase),
defined in dune-fem's python/dune/fem/space/_spaces.py:

  def raviartThomas(gridView, order=0, dimRange=None, ...)

Note: the underlying C++ header IS lowercase
('dune/fem/space/raviartthomas.hh') — that's the source
of catalog confusion. But the Python factory function
exposed by 'from dune.fem.space import ...' is
camelCase.

PORTABILITY FIX (2026-08-03). The first version of this
fixture hard-coded an absolute path into one developer's
DUNE source checkout (/home/user/Schreibtisch/
dune-src/...) plus an absolute path to the catalog. On
any other machine it printed "FAIL: <path> not found"
and counted as failed, even though the claim it verifies
is true. It now resolves both locations from the running
process:

  * the space module through `import dune.fem.space._spaces`
    (falling back to a dune-src checkout if one exists),
    so it inspects the DUNE that is actually INSTALLED
    rather than a checkout that may not match;
  * the catalog root relative to this file, so the fixture
    works from a git worktree.

It asserts:
  * 'def raviartThomas(' is present in _spaces.py
  * 'def raviartthomas(' (lowercase) is ABSENT from the
    same file (regression catches any future alias add)
  * the '.hh' include for the C++ header IS lowercase
    (confirms why the catalog confused it)
  * the catalog contains no bare lowercase spelling

Executed against dune-fem 2.12.0.2 on 2026-08-03:
camelCase def present, lowercase def absent,
'raviartthomas.hh' present at _spaces.py:922,
catalog_lowercase_count=0.

MUTATION CONTROL. T2_MUTATE=1 appends a synthetic
`def raviartthomas(` line to the _spaces.py text being scanned — the
pathology removed, i.e. the world in which dune-fem ships a lowercase
alias after all. raviartthomas_lowercase_def_present then reads True,
that expectation disappears and a FAIL: line appears. The file on disk
is never touched; only the in-memory copy is.
