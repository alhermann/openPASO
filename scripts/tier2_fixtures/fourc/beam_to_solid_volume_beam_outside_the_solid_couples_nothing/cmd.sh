# Tier-2 for fourc::beam_interaction#3 — the rule is confirmed and the promised
# diagnostic does not exist.
#
# Claimed:  "Beams outside the solid domain are not coupled.  Signal:
#           BeamToSolidMeshtying diagnostic prints `0 of N beam segments
#           coupled`; the beam displaces freely as if no solid mesh existed."
# Observed: the physics is exactly right, and 4C prints nothing at all.  Nothing
#           in the log matches "segments coupled", and no line reports how many
#           pairs were found or lost.  The only place the coupling shows up is
#           the beam-to-solid runtime VTK output, which the deck has to have
#           switched on: the segmentation file's point count is the coupled
#           segment endpoints and the integration-points file's count is the
#           coupling quadrature points.
#
# Upstream beam3r_herm2line3_static_beam_to_solid_volume_meshtying_beam_in_solid_column_segmentation.4C.yaml
# threads a beam up the axis of a hex8 column.  Translating only the nine beam
# node coordinates by +1.0 in x — still well inside the binning box — takes the
# beam out of the solid and:
#   * the segmentation output falls from 26 points (13 coupled segments) to 0,
#     at every one of the writes, and the integration points from 78 to 0;
#   * the solid stops moving entirely — its probed node reports displacement
#     exactly 0.00000000000000000e+00, i.e. the beam is loading nothing;
#   * the beam itself bends further than the coupled reference, which is the
#     "displaces freely" half of the claim;
#   * and the run still exits through the result test, not through any coupling
#     check, because there is no coupling check.
#
# NOTE ON THE BUILD: this checkout is FOUR_C_WITH_ARBORX=OFF.  That only rules
# out SEARCH_STRATEGY: bounding_volume_hierarchy; the default
# bruteforce_with_binning path used here needs no ArborX and runs in seconds.
