# Tier-2 for fourc::brownian_dynamics#2 — cross-link stiffness has a working
# window, and both walls of it are hard aborts in different subsystems.
#
# The stiffness knob is not on MAT_Crosslinker itself: MAT_Crosslinker points at
# a beam material through MATNUM, and that beam's YOUNG is k_xl.  Upstream's
# periodic-RVE crosslinking deck uses 1.3e+09 there (MAT 3, separate from the
# filament material MAT 1 even though the two happen to carry the same numbers).
#
#   1.3e+09  upstream: runs, passes its own result test
#   1.3e+03  too soft: the linker stretches past half the periodic box and 4C
#            aborts in the crosslinking submodel evaluator with
#              You are trying to set the binding spot positions of this crosslinker in at least one direction
#            — the network has lost its elastic constraint, exactly the
#            "deforms like a viscous fluid" end of the claim
#   1.3e+15  too stiff: the Newton solve for the constrained network stops
#            converging and 4C aborts with
#              The nonlinear solver did not converge!
#            from solver_nonlin_nox/4C_solver_nonlin_nox_problem.cpp — the
#            "rigid, fluctuations locked out" end
#
# Only MAT 3 is touched; the filament material is left alone in every arm.
