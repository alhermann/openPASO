# Tier-2 for fourc::brownian_dynamics#3 — periodicity for an RVE is not a
# refinement, it is what makes the load reach the network at all.
#
# The entry says a free-boundary RVE "produces non-physical edge effects" and
# gets the average stress wrong by 5-20%, and points at DESIGN PERIODIC
# CONDITIONS.  Two things are worth correcting.
#
# First, the knob in 4C is PERIODICONOFF inside BINNING STRATEGY, alongside
# DOMAINBOUNDINGBOX — not a DESIGN condition block.  Upstream's RVE deck drives
# the box through PERIODIC BOUNDINGBOX ELEMENTS plus DESIGN SURF DIRICH
# CONDITIONS on its corner nodes.
#
# Second, the consequence is not a 5-20% stress error.  Delete the single
# PERIODICONOFF line and the filament stops being loaded at all: node 2's
# displacement comes back 0.00000000000000000e+00 in every component, against a
# prescribed -2.47500871887900376e-01 axially.  The RVE deformation never
# reaches the network, the run exits normally, and 4C prints no warning.  A
# "20% off" screen would pass this; a zero-response check catches it at once.
