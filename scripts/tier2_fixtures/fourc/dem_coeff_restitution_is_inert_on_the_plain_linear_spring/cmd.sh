#
# Claimed: COEFF_RESTITUTION on the plain NormalLinearSpring is inert; the deck
#          runs bit-identically with and without it.
#
# Measured as an IDENTITY on the verdict lines, which is the only thing that
# settles inertness. A positive control is included so the identity is known to
# be informative: NORMAL_STIFF, a parameter the law DOES use, moves the same
# lines under the same comparison.
#
# T2_MUTATE=1 removes the pathology: COEFF_RESTITUTION is not added at all, so
# the two decks compared are literally the same file, the identity holds for a
# trivial reason and IDENTITY_IS_INFORMATIVE flips to no.
