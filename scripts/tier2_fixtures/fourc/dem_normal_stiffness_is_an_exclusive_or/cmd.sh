# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_dem#2 — the DEM normal stiffness is an
# exclusive-or, and all three ways of getting it wrong print the SAME sentence.
#
# Claimed: set EITHER NORMAL_STIFF, OR REL_PENETRATION together with
#          MAX_VELOCITY. Both, neither, or REL_PENETRATION without MAX_VELOCITY
#          abort with one identical message that does not say which half is
#          wrong.
#
# The two upstream decks are the two legal halves: ..._stiffset sets
# NORMAL_STIFF, ..._stiffauto sets REL_PENETRATION + MAX_VELOCITY. Both pass
# untouched. Each of the three illegal combinations is built from stiffauto by
# a single edit.
#
# T2_MUTATE=1 removes the pathology: the three broken decks are built without
# their edit, i.e. they are three copies of the working stiffauto deck. The
# abort then never happens, XOR_ABORTS drops to 0 and every EXIT_* becomes 0,
# so the fixture must go red.
