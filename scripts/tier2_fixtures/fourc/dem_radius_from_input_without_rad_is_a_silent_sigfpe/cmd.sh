# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_dem#4 — RadiusFromParticleInput with no RAD token
# is a silent divide-by-zero, not an error.
#
# Claimed: the radius stays 0, the MIN/MAX bounds check PASSES because
#          MIN_RADIUS defaults to 0.0, and the run dies on a raw SIGFPE with no
#          4C error block. Setting MIN_RADIUS above zero converts it into a
#          clean abort.
#
# T2_MUTATE=1 removes the pathology: INITIAL_RADIUS is left at its
# RadiusFromParticleMaterial default, so the radius comes from the material,
# there is no SIGFPE, EXIT_NORAD becomes 0 and the fixture must go red.
