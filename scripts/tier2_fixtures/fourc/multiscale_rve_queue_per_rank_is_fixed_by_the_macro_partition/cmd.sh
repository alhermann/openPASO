# Tier-2 for fourc::multiscale#5 — the RVE queue length per MPI rank is decided
# by the macro partition, it is badly uneven, and it never changes during the
# run.  Measured in RVE COUNTS, never in seconds.
#
# Upstream sohex8_multiscale_macro.4C.yaml is 8 hex8 macro elements, each with 8
# Gauss points, each Gauss point carrying its own MAT_Struct_Multiscale RVE: 64
# RVE solves per macro Newton step in total.  Every one of them is solved by
# whichever rank owns the macro element, so "RVEs on this rank" is exactly
# 8 x (macro elements owned).  4C writes that ownership itself, as the
# element_owner cell array of its structure runtime VTK output.
#
#   1 rank   8 elements          -> one queue of 64
#   2 ranks  3 and 5 elements    -> queues of 24 and 40
#   3 ranks  1, 3 and 4 elements -> queues of  8, 24 and 32, a four-to-one spread
#
# on a mesh where a perfect split would be 2-3-3.  The spread is not a transient:
# the element_owner map at the last output step is identical to the one at the
# first, so nothing was redistributed while the run was going on, which is the
# entry's point.  And all three runs pass all three result tests with the same
# values, so the imbalance is invisible in the answer — the only way to see it is
# to count who owns what, exactly as done here.
#
# Nothing in this fixture reads a clock.  Wall time is not an admissible
# observable and is not used.
