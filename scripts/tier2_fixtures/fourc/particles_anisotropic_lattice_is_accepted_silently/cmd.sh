# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#2 — a PD lattice with different spacing in x and y
# is accepted without a word and changes the answer.
#
# Upstream particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml packs its 162 pdphase
# particles on a square lattice at dx = dy = 1.0, declares
# PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING: 1.0 and INTERACTION_HORIZON: 3.0.  The mutant keeps
# the same 162 particles and the same declared spacing but halves every pdphase
# y-coordinate, so the lattice becomes dx = 1.0, dy = 0.5: the horizon now
# reaches 3 particle rows in x and 6 in y.
#
# 4C says nothing.  No spacing check, no packing check, no neighbour-count
# complaint — the only trace is that the bond list grows by more than half,
# because each particle acquires twice as many partners along y as along x while
# every one of those bonds is still weighted with the single scalar dx^4 volume
# correction.  That is the anisotropy the entry warns about, in countable form.
# The run then completes and fails 8 of its 10 result tests.
