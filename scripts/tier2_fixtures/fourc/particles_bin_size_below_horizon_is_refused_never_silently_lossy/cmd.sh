# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#9 — the constraint is real and enforced, so the
# degraded-neighbour-search scenario the entry describes cannot occur.
#
# Claimed:  "too small a bin (< horizon) misses neighbour pairs at bin
#           boundaries — pd_neighbor_pairs drops below the expected
#           ~ 4*pi*delta^2 / dx^2 per particle, fracture pattern develops
#           spurious gaps at bin boundaries."
# Observed: you never get that far.  The SPHPeridynamic constructor asserts
#           horizon <= BIN_SIZE_LOWER_BOUND and a smaller bin aborts at setup
#           with
#             Peridynamic INTERACTION_HORIZON must be smaller than
#             BIN_SIZE_LOWER_BOUND!
#           from particle/src/interaction/4C_particle_interaction_sph_peridynamic.cpp,
#           before the bond list is built, before the first step and before any
#           pair count is printed.  There is no partially-populated neighbour
#           search to inspect and no fracture pattern to look at.
#
# The two pieces of advice in the entry are also both off:
#   * "must be > horizon" — bin exactly EQUAL to the horizon is accepted and
#     passes every result test; the guard is <=, not <.
#   * "ideally 1.5 * horizon" — 1.5*horizon, the upstream 5, and the horizon
#     itself all give the identical 1512-bond list and the identical verdict, so
#     the recommendation buys nothing.  Bin size is a decomposition knob here,
#     not a physics knob.
#   * the quoted target of ~4*pi*delta^2/dx^2 pairs per particle is roughly a
#     hundred for this deck; the real count on a 2-D lattice is about nineteen.
