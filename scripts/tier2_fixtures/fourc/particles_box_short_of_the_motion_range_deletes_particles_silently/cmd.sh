# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#10 — the rule holds, the Signal does not, and the
# outcome is worse than the one claimed.
#
# Claimed:  "an impactor moving outside the original bounding box triggers
#           'particle out of domain' from 4C particle engine — simulation aborts
#           mid-run."
# Observed: nothing aborts.  Upstream particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml is
#           driven by gravity along +x; pulling the box's +x face in from 20.0 to
#           17.0 leaves every particle inside at setup except the outermost wall
#           column, and then, as the body travels, 4C quietly DELETES the
#           particles that cross the face and keeps integrating.  The only trace
#           is
#             on processor 0 removed 3 particle(s) being outside the
#             computational domain!
#           which names no id, no position, no step and no phase.  It fires twice
#           after the run has started — those are particles that WERE inside the
#           box at t=0 and left it while moving, which is exactly the motion
#           range the entry is about — and all 3000 steps still run.  The string
#           "particle out of domain" does not appear anywhere.
#
# The failure only surfaces at the very end, as eight wrong result values, so a
# too-small box does not stop a run: it silently deletes part of the model and
# hands back an answer.
