# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#4 — PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING is a free parameter
# that 4C never compares against the particles you actually gave it.
#
# Upstream particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml packs its pdphase body on a
# lattice of pitch 1.0 and declares PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING: 1.0.  The mutants
# change ONLY the declared number; every particle position stays where it was.
#
#   MATCHED : the reference, 1512 bonds, all ten result tests pass.
#   OFF5PCT : declare 1.05 instead of 1.00.  Identical bond list — the neighbour
#             search uses the horizon, not this key — no warning of any kind,
#             all 3001 steps run, and 8 of the 10 result values are wrong.  A
#             five per cent slip is already fatal to the answer and completely
#             invisible.
#   HALF    : declare 0.5.  Again 1512 bonds and 3001 silent steps, and the body
#             lands somewhere else entirely.  In 2-D the bond force carries
#             dx^4, so this is a sixteen-fold error in every bond stiffness.
#
# There is no check anywhere: 4C reads the key, cubes and squares it into the
# micromodulus and the volume correction, and never looks at a single pairwise
# distance.  The entry's advice to verify dx yourself from the particle
# coordinates is the only thing that catches it.
