# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#3 — the rule holds, the neighbour count does not.
#
# Claimed:  "setting INTERACTION_HORIZON < 2*dx in PARTICLE DYNAMIC/PD gives a
#           MAT_ParticlePD model with each particle only seeing 1-2 neighbours —
#           bond count is too sparse, stiffness is mesh-dependent and
#           convergence as dx -> 0 fails."
# Observed: on a square lattice the neighbourhood is never that thin.  Upstream
#           particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml has 162 pdphase particles at
#           dx = 1.0.  At the entry's own m = 3 the bond list holds 1512 pairs.
#           Dropping to horizon 1.5 (m = 1.5, below the 2*dx line) still leaves
#           519 pairs, and even at horizon 1.0 — the tightest horizon that
#           connects anything at all — there are 279 pairs.  Per particle that is
#           roughly six and three partners, not one or two: the 3x3 stencil
#           minus the centre, then its four axial members.
#
# What the too-small horizon actually costs you is not silent mesh dependence:
# both under-resolved runs go unstable and 4C kills them with
#   a particle of phase 'pdphase' traveled more than one bin on this processor!
# after a few dozen steps, having printed no word about the horizon.  An agent
# told to diagnose this by counting neighbours will find plenty of them.
