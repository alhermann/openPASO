# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#8 — the CFL formula is not the stability limit, and
# the failure mode is not a NaN.
#
# Claimed:  "CFL condition for PD: dt < 0.5 * dx / c_wave where
#           c_wave = sqrt(E/rho).  Signal: dt > CFL gives NaN within ~10 time
#           steps (typical 'energy not conserved' message)."
# Observed: 4C's own regression deck breaks that bound and passes.  Upstream
#           particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml has YOUNG 190.0e3,
#           INITDENSITY 8000.0e-9 and dx 1.0, so the formula gives a limit of
#           3.24e-06 s — and the deck runs at 8.0e-06 s, 2.47 times larger, for
#           3000 steps with all ten result tests exact.  Raising dt to 1.0e-05,
#           3.08 times the "limit", still completes every step.  The real
#           boundary is somewhere above three times the quoted one, so an agent
#           that applies this rule literally will shrink a working time step by
#           a factor of three and pay for it.
#
#           When dt really is too large the run does not produce a NaN and does
#           not mention energy.  At 1.6e-04 it is killed after 8 steps by
#             a particle of phase 'pdphase' traveled more than one bin on this
#             processor!
#           from particle/src/algorithm/4C_particle_algorithm.cpp.  No NaN
#           appears anywhere in any of the logs, and the string "energy not
#           conserved" does not exist in 4C.
