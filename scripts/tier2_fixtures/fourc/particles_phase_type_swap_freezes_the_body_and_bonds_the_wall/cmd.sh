# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#7 — swapping the phase labels is confirmed to be
# fatal, and the diagnostic points at a missing STATE, not at a wrong TYPE.
#
# Upstream particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml has 444 boundaryphase wall
# particles and 162 pdphase body particles, mapped by
# PHASE_TO_MATERIAL_ID: "boundaryphase 1 pdphase 2".  The mutant exchanges the
# two TYPE labels and touches nothing else, exactly the mix-up the entry warns
# about.
#
# What happens:
#   * The wall becomes the peridynamic body.  The bond list grows from 1512 to
#     3588 pairs — the structure that was supposed to be rigid is now the thing
#     that deforms.
#   * The former body is now boundaryphase, and boundary particles do not move:
#     4C reports its probe particle at posx 6.50000000000000000e+00 with velx
#     and vely exactly 0.00000000000000000e+00 after 3000 steps.  That is the
#     entry's "sticks to it, no rebound", in numbers.
#   * The only complaint 4C makes is
#       state 'pd_damage_phi' not found in container!
#     from particle/src/algorithm/4C_particle_algorithm_result_test.cpp, because
#     the probed particle no longer carries peridynamic states.  It names a
#     state, never a phase, a TYPE or PHASE_TO_MATERIAL_ID, so an agent reading
#     it looks for a broken output request rather than a swapped label.
