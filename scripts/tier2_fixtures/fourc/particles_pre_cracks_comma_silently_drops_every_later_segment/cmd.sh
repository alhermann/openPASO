# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#5 — the separator rule is real, the consequence is
# the opposite of the one claimed.
#
# PROVENANCE WARNING.  PRE_CRACKS and the deck
# particle_sph_2d_pdbody_precrack_fixedflag.4C.yaml are NOT in upstream 4C main;
# they are local branch work on bond-based peridynamics in the checkout this ran
# against.  This fixture therefore certifies branch behaviour and aborts loudly
# (FIXTURE_ABORT=no_upstream_decks) wherever the deck is absent.
#
# Claimed:  "mis-formatted PRE_CRACKS (e.g. comma separator, or missing
#           semicolons between segments) parses as ONE crack with concatenated
#           endpoints — bonds across all spurious segments break instead of just
#           the intended ones."
# Observed: nothing spurious breaks.  The parser splits on ';' and then reads
#           exactly four numbers from each piece, so a comma-separated or
#           run-together list collapses to the FIRST crack and everything after
#           it is thrown away.  You get FEWER broken bonds than you asked for,
#           not more, and no endpoints are concatenated.
#
# Counting bonds on the same 10x10 plate:
#   no crack                                       1058 bonds
#   one segment                                     974 bonds  ( 84 broken)
#   two segments, ';' separated                     890 bonds  (168 broken)
#   the same two, ',' separated                     974 bonds  ( 84 broken)
#   the same two, no separator at all               974 bonds  ( 84 broken)
# The two malformed spellings land on the one-segment count exactly, and 4C
# prints "Number of pre-crack segments: 1" and then a completely clean run —
# exit 0, every result test passing — because the deck's reference values were
# built for one crack.  A silently halved crack set that still says PASS is a
# far worse failure mode than the claimed over-breaking, which cannot happen.
