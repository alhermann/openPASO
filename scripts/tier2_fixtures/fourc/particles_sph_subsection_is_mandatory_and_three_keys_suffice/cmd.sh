# Tier-2 for fourc::particles#0 — the rule holds, the Signal is fabricated, and
# the prescribed three-key SPH block really is enough.
#
# Claimed:  "omitting the SPH section gives pd_neighbor_pairs = 0 at runtime
#           (visible in stderr) and zero displacement, with NO error message —
#           4C happily runs a no-force simulation."
# Observed: it does not run at all.  Deleting PARTICLE DYNAMIC/SPH from upstream
#           particle_sph_2d_pdbody_gravity.4C.yaml aborts before the first time
#           step with
#             negative initial particle spacing!
#           from particle/src/interaction/4C_particle_interaction_sph.cpp —
#           INITIALPARTICLESPACING lives in that sub-section and sets every
#           particle's mass, so its default of -1 is caught immediately.  Not one
#           time step is taken, so there is no displacement to look at.
#
# The quoted symptom is worse than merely absent: a HEALTHY run prints
# "Number of pd_neighbor_pairs in peridynamic evaluation on this proc: 0" for
# most of its steps (that counter is the body-to-body CONTACT pair list, not the
# bond list), so an agent taught to read a zero there as a broken deck will
# condemn a correct one.
#
# The entry's remedy is checked too: cutting the SPH block down to exactly the
# three keys it names — KERNEL, KERNEL_SPACE_DIM, INITIALPARTICLESPACING —
# reproduces the upstream run bit for bit, so BOUNDARYPARTICLEFORMULATION and
# TRANSPORTVELOCITYFORMULATION are inert for a pure PD body.
