# Tier-2 for fourc::pasi#1 — the particle interaction model must match the
# materials and the wall treatment, and 4C does not check it.
#
# Claimed:  a mismatch "produces 'interaction type mismatch' or silent zero-force
#           coupling".
# Observed: neither.  Switching INTERACTION from DEM to SPH on the upstream
#           two-way DEM/membrane PASI deck — leaving MAT_ParticleDEM,
#           MAT_ParticleWallDEM and the PARTICLE DYNAMIC/DEM section exactly
#           where they were, which is precisely the mismatch the entry describes
#           — makes 4C print its time-stepping banner and then take
#             Signal: Segmentation fault (11) / Address not mapped (1)
#           with no PROC 0 ERROR block, no message, no MPI_Abort banner and a
#           signal exit status rather than 1.  There is no 'interaction type
#           mismatch' string in the output and the coupling never gets far
#           enough to be silently zero.
#
# That matters operationally: an agent watching for a non-zero exit plus a
# diagnostic gets a bare crash, and one watching for zero forces gets no output
# to inspect at all.
