# Tier-2 for fourc::pasi#0 — BINNING STRATEGY is indeed mandatory for a PASI run,
# and the message you get says nothing about PASI, binning or contact search.
#
# Claimed:  "omitting BINNING STRATEGY aborts with 'no binning strategy defined
#           for PASI' at setup".
# Observed: the section is declared optional in 4C's input spec, so the deck
#           parses, both fields are set up, the time-stepping banner is printed —
#           and then it dies inside the binning strategy on an empty domain with
#             We need a discretization at this point.
#           from core/binstrategy/4C_binstrategy.cpp.  That sentence contains
#           neither "binning" nor "PASI" nor "strategy"; an agent grepping the
#           error for any word from the claim finds nothing, and the natural
#           reading ("some discretisation is missing") points at the mesh rather
#           than at the missing section.
