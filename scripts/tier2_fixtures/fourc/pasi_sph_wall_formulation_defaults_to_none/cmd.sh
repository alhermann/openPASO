# Tier-2 for fourc::pasi#5 — SPH-structure coupling needs an explicit wall
# treatment, and 4C's default is to have none.
#
# The knob is WALLFORMULATION in PARTICLE DYNAMIC/SPH.  Its default is
# NoWallFormulation, so leaving it out is not "using the plain coupling" — it is
# switching the boundary treatment off.  Upstream's piston deck sets
# VirtualParticleWallFormulation; deleting that one line is the whole mutation.
#
# The result is exactly the mechanism the entry describes, and it is silent:
# 4C emits no warning, runs the full coupled loop and reaches the result test,
# but the fluid particle's density falls from 9.99658304322867730e-01 to
# 8.99761790578682885e-01 — a 10% deficit, which is what a kernel whose support
# crosses the wall into empty space computes — and its z-velocity flips sign
# from -2.47255596595578497e-01 to 1.36328793070252097e+00, i.e. it is no longer
# being held off the piston face.  Six of the deck's eighteen result tests fail.
