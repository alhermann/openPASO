# Tier-2 for fourc::pasi#3 — a step that suits the structure but not the particle
# contact does not show up as wobbling particles; it stops the coupling.
#
# Claimed:  "a coupled simulation that respects structural CFL but exceeds
#           particle stability shows particle positions oscillating wildly within
#           each structural step."
# Observed: you never get to see that.  4C runs a partitioned two-way PASI
#           iteration inside each step, and once the particle response stops
#           being a contraction the iteration simply fails to converge:
#             The partitioned PASI solver did not converge in ITEMAX steps!
#           from pasi/4C_pasi_partitioned_twowaycoup.cpp.  It aborts there; no
#           particle trajectory is written for the offending step and nothing in
#           the message names the particle field, the contact stiffness or the
#           time step.
#
# Both arms use the SAME structural model and the SAME contact parameters; only
# PASI DYNAMIC/TIMESTEP moves, from 5e-4 to 5e-3.
