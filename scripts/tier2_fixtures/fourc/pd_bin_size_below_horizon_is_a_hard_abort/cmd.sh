# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#4 — BIN_SIZE_LOWER_BOUND really must not be
# smaller than the peridynamic horizon, but 4C does not let you find out the
# way the entry described.
#
# Claimed:  a silent degradation — "neighbor_count diagnostics from
#           BinningStrategy show ~50-70% of expected bonds" and the wave speed
#           comes out roughly the square root of the true one.
# Observed: a hard abort in the SPHPeridynamic constructor, before a single time
#           step, with the message
#             Peridynamic INTERACTION_HORIZON must be smaller than BIN_SIZE_LOWER_BOUND!
#           from particle/src/interaction/4C_particle_interaction_sph_peridynamic.cpp.
#           There is nothing silent about it and there are no bonds to miscount:
#           the "Number of initialized peridynamic bonds" line, which is the
#           only bond-count diagnostic 4C has, is never reached.
#
# Worth knowing: the guard is horizon <= bin size, so equality is accepted even
# though the message says "smaller than".  The fixture pins that too.
