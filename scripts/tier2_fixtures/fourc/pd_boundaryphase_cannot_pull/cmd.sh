# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#10 — boundaryphase can push a peridynamic body
# and cannot pull it, so it is useless for any opening or tensile load case.
#
# Self-contained 2-D deck: a 6 x 6 pdphase plate whose left column sits at
# x = 1.5, and a 6-particle boundaryphase wall at x = 0.5, i.e. exactly one
# PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING away.  The wall is driven by a Dirichlet function
# whose only difference between the two arms is the SIGN of the velocity:
#
#   PULL : wall displacement -25*t  -> wall retreats from the plate
#   PUSH : wall displacement +25*t  -> wall advances into the plate
#
# PULL: the plate does not move at all.  Its edge particle ends at posx = 1.5
# and velx = 0 with abs(diff) exactly 0.00000000000000000e+00, and the
# "Number of pd_neighbor_pairs in peridynamic evaluation on this proc" line
# reads 0 on every single step — no contact pair is ever created, because a pair
# only exists where the separation is BELOW the grid spacing.  There is no
# tensile branch to reach.
#
# PUSH: pairs appear and the plate is accelerated.  Same deck, same wall, same
# speed, opposite sign.
