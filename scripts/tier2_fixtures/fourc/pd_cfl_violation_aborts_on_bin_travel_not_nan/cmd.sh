# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#6 — an over-large explicit time step really does
# destroy a PD run, but you never get to see the NaN.
#
# Claimed:  "kinetic energy grows monotonically with each step, particle
#           velocities saturate at NaN within a few hundred steps; or 4C aborts
#           with `non-finite velocity at particle X`".
# Observed: 4C aborts long before anything becomes non-finite, in the particle
#           algorithm's own bookkeeping:
#             a particle of phase 'pdphase' traveled more than one bin on this processor!
#           from particle/src/algorithm/4C_particle_algorithm.cpp.  The message
#           names the PHASE, not the particle, prints no velocity and no step
#           index, and says nothing about stability or the CFL condition — so an
#           agent grepping for "nan" or "velocity" learns nothing.  There is no
#           `non-finite velocity at particle X` string in 4C at all, and the log
#           contains no NaN.
#
# The upstream deck runs at dt = 8e-6; the bad arm uses 1.6e-4.
