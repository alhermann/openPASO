# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#3 — the horizon ratio m = INTERACTION_HORIZON /
# PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING is a first-class discretisation parameter, and 4C
# gives you a direct read-out of it that the entry did not mention.
#
# Claimed:  m = 2 puts the stress field 10-20% off the analytic elasticity
#           solution, m = 3 gives 1-3%, m = 4 gives < 1%, with m = 3-4 the
#           practical sweet spot.
# Observed: none of that is reachable from a 4C log, and the upstream PD deck
#           does not show a plateau at m = 3-4 — the answer keeps drifting
#           monotonically all the way to m = 5.  What IS directly observable is
#           the line 4C prints once per run,
#             Number of initialized peridynamic bonds on this proc: N
#           which is the discrete count of the horizon neighbourhood and grows
#           like m^2 in 2-D.  On this deck (dx = 1) it goes
#             m=1.5 -> 519,  m=2 -> 753,  m=3 -> 1512,  m=4 -> 2260,  m=5 -> 3155.
#           Halving m from 3 to 2 halves the bond count, which is the concrete
#           thing "m must be at least 3" is protecting you from.
#
# BIN_SIZE_LOWER_BOUND is raised to 8 in every arm so that the m = 4 and m = 5
# arms clear 4C's horizon <= bin-size assertion; that raise alone changes
# nothing (the m = 3 arm still passes the deck's own result tests), which the
# fixture also checks.
