# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#7 — FALSE as written.
#
# Claimed:  "INITRADIUS in the material must equal dx/2.  An inconsistent value
#           causes incorrect mass and volume computation.  Signal: total system
#           mass printed at startup differs ... momentum conservation fails
#           after the first step."
# Observed: INITRADIUS has no effect whatsoever on a peridynamic run.  Multiply
#           it by ten on BOTH materials of the upstream 2-D PD deck and every
#           one of the ten result tests still passes with abs(diff) exactly
#           0.00000000000000000e+00 — the answer is bit-identical, not merely
#           close.  4C never prints a total system mass at startup either.
#
#           The parameter that actually sets the mass is INITIALPARTICLESPACING
#           in PARTICLE DYNAMIC/SPH: particle mass is INITDENSITY *
#           INITIALPARTICLESPACING^KERNEL_SPACE_DIM.  Doubling it breaks eight of
#           the ten tests, which is the control arm here.  PD bond forces use
#           PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING and the horizon; PD contact gaps are
#           measured against PERIDYNAMIC_GRID_SPACING, not against radii.
#
# So the advice to keep INITRADIUS = dx/2 is harmless bookkeeping, but it is not
# what protects the mass, and an agent that "fixes" INITRADIUS to chase a mass
# error will change nothing.
