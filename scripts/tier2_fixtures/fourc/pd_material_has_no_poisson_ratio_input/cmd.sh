# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#8 — the physics is right, the Signal describes
# something 4C makes impossible.
#
# Claimed:  "a bond-based PD problem in the PARTICLE DYNAMIC/PD MAT_ParticlePD
#           MATERIALS entry at nu != these fixed values RUNS but the resulting
#           Poisson contraction matches 0.25 (2D) or 0.33 (3D) regardless of the
#           input nu."
# Observed: there is no input nu.  MAT_ParticlePD takes exactly four keys —
#           INITRADIUS, INITDENSITY, YOUNG, CRITICAL_STRETCH — and adding a
#           Poisson ratio under any of the usual spellings is a hard parse
#           error: "Could not match this input" from
#           global_data/4C_global_data_read.cpp, with 4C echoing the whole
#           MATERIALS block back.  So the deck never runs and there is no
#           contraction to compare.
#
# The underlying restriction is real — bond-based PD fixes nu at 1/4 in plane
# strain and 1/3 in 3-D — but 4C enforces it by not offering the knob, not by
# silently overriding one.  An agent told to "check whether the contraction
# matches 0.25 despite your nu" will be looking for an observation that cannot
# be made.  Three spellings are tried so the fixture does not rest on one guess.
