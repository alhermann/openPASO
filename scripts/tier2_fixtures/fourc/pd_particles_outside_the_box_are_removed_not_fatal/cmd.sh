# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#1 — DOMAINBOUNDINGBOX really must enclose every
# particle, but the consequence of getting it wrong is NOT a crash.
#
# Claimed:  "the simulation crashes", with a runtime abort
#           `particle outside DOMAINBOUNDINGBOX at step N` /
#           `BinningStrategy: particle position out of bounds`, printing the
#           offending position.
# Observed: 4C silently DELETES the offending particles and carries on.  The
#           only trace is one line —
#             on processor 0 removed N particle(s) being outside the computational domain!
#           — with no id, no position, no step number and no phase.  It fires
#           once at setup for particles that start outside, and again later in
#           the run for particles that leave.  The simulation then runs to the
#           end with a mutilated body and the failure surfaces at the very end
#           as "expected 10 tests but performed 0", because the result-tested
#           particle ids no longer exist.
#
# On the upstream 2-D PD deck a 40 x 40 box is shrunk to 28 x 40 in x.
