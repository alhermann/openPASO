# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#11 — PDFIXED 1 on a particle line really does pin
# that particle, and dropping it really does let the specimen move off as a body.
#
# NOTE ON PROVENANCE.  PDFIXED and the deck used here,
# particle_sph_2d_pdbody_precrack_fixedflag.4C.yaml, are NOT in upstream 4C
# main.  They come from local branch work on bond-based peridynamics in the
# checkout this was run against.  The fixture aborts loudly rather than passing
# silently where the deck is absent.
#
# The deck clamps the whole left column (ten particles at x = -4.5) with
# PDFIXED 1 and pulls the plate with gravity in +x.  Particle 0 is result-tested
# at exactly its reference position (-4.5, -4.5) with zero velocity.
#
# Strip ' PDFIXED 1' from the ten particle lines and nothing else changes — the
# same pre-crack, the same 974 initialised bonds, the same damage at the probe
# particle.  4C prints no warning.  But the clamp is gone, so the plate is no
# longer held: ten of the fourteen result tests fail, including the clamped
# particle's own position and velocity, while the two pd_damage_phi tests still
# pass — a reader checking only the crack sees a healthy run.
