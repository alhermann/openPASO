# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#13 — PD_DIMENSION is a constitutive choice, not a
# label, and 4C will not tell you if you pick the wrong one.
#
# The entry gives two critical-stretch formulas, one for plane strain and one
# for plane stress, and warns that mixing them puts fracture initiation at the
# wrong load.  The half an agent can actually check in a log is upstream of the
# stretch formula: the SAME CRITICAL_STRETCH and the SAME horizon under
# Peridynamic_2DPlaneStrain and Peridynamic_2DPlaneStress are two different
# problems, because the bond micromodulus is normalised by 5/(pi*delta^3) in
# plane strain and 6/(pi*delta^3) in plane stress.
#
# Flipping only that one enum on the upstream 2-D PD deck:
#   * initialises the identical 1512 bonds, so nothing about the discretisation
#     or the neighbourhood changed and no count betrays it;
#   * emits no warning of any kind;
#   * and still breaks eight of the deck's ten result tests.
#
# So the enum is silent, geometric diagnostics cannot catch it, and the only
# evidence is the answer itself.
