# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#5 — PRE_CRACKS coordinates in the wrong units
# are accepted without complaint and break (almost) nothing.
#
# NOTE ON PROVENANCE.  PRE_CRACKS and the deck used here,
# particle_sph_2d_pdbody_precrack_fixedflag.4C.yaml, are NOT in upstream 4C
# main.  They come from local branch work on bond-based peridynamics in the
# checkout this was run against.  The behaviour below is real and reproducible,
# but it is branch behaviour, not upstream behaviour, and the fixture aborts
# loudly rather than silently passing if the deck is absent.
#
# The deck cuts a horizontal pre-crack from (-5, 0) to (0, 0) through a 10 x 10
# plate of unit-spaced particles.  4C reports "Number of pre-crack segments: 1"
# and the initialised bond count drops from 1058 (no crack) to 974, i.e. 84
# bonds are broken at t = 0 and the probe particle reports pd_damage_phi = 0.357.
#
# Rescale only the crack endpoints by 1e-3, the classic mm-vs-m slip, and every
# one of those signals except the damage stays reassuring: the segment is still
# parsed, "Number of pre-crack segments: 1" is still printed, no warning is
# emitted — and the bond count comes back 1056, so 2 bonds are broken instead of
# 84 and the damage field is flat zero.  The only way to notice is to compare
# the bond count against the no-crack run, which is what this fixture does.
