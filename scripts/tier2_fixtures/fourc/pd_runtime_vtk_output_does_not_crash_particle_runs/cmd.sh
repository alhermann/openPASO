# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#12 — FALSE.
#
# Claimed:  "IO/RUNTIME VTK OUTPUT sections are INCOMPATIBLE with particle
#           problems — they crash 4C.  Remove them.  Signal: 4C aborts on
#           startup with `IO/RUNTIME VTK OUTPUT not supported for particle
#           problems` or `RuntimeVTKOutputParams: invalid for PARTICLE`."
# Observed: nothing of the sort.  Bolting IO/RUNTIME VTK OUTPUT and
#           IO/RUNTIME VTK OUTPUT/STRUCTURE onto the upstream 2-D PD deck runs
#           to completion, exits 0, passes all ten of its result tests with
#           abs(diff) exactly 0.00000000000000000e+00 against the untouched
#           baseline, and additionally writes the runtime VTK files.  Neither
#           quoted message exists anywhere in the output.
#
# Deleting these sections on the strength of the entry is therefore a pure loss:
# it removes output an agent may well want and fixes nothing.  Two upstream
# Polymer_Network decks ship IO/RUNTIME VTK OUTPUT blocks for the same reason.
