# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_pd#0 — the PARTICLE DYNAMIC/SPH sub-section really is
# mandatory for a peridynamic run, but BOTH of the diagnostics the entry quoted
# are wrong about it.
#
# Claimed:  removing the SPH parameters "causes the code to crash with
#           'pd_neighbor_pairs = 0'", or prints
#           'BOUNDARYPARTICLEFORMULATION not set' during SPH section parsing.
# Observed: it aborts in ParticleInteractionSPH::set_initial_states with
#           "negative initial particle spacing!" — INITIALPARTICLESPACING lives in
#           that sub-section and defaults to a negative sentinel, and the mass of
#           every particle is rho * INITIALPARTICLESPACING^dim.  Nothing about
#           neighbour pairs or boundary formulations is mentioned.
#
# The second half matters more.  4C does print a pd_neighbor_pairs line —
# "Number of pd_neighbor_pairs in peridynamic evaluation on this proc: N" — but
# that is the count of *inter-body contact* pairs, and it is legitimately 0 on
# every step of a healthy single-contact-free run.  The baseline deck, which
# passes all ten of its own result tests, prints it as 0 thousands of times.
# Treating "pd_neighbor_pairs = 0" as an error signal is therefore a false alarm
# generator, which is why the baseline count is asserted below.
