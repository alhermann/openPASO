# and its ELEMENTS / NODES / MATERIALS counts are read into a parameter
# list and never consumed (the source comments them as unused).
# Three runs of the same 1-element HEX8 deck: without the section, with
# correct counts, and with deliberately absurd counts. All three must
# produce the SAME displacement, proving the counts are inert and that
# a mismatch is never the cause of a failure.

# MUTATION CONTROL — a POSITIVE one, because this fixture asserts an ABSENCE of
# effect and no removal of its "pathology" can make it red.  Making the absurd
# counts correct just turns the third arm into a copy of the second, which
# passes a fortiori; the claim is exactly that the two decks behave identically.
# So the control instead proves the EXIT probe is a live measurement: T2_MUTATE=1
# perturbs the pinned RESULT DESCRIPTION displacement in the absurd_counts arm by
# 1%, well outside its 1e-12 tolerance.  4C's own result test then fails, the arm
# exits 1, `absurd_counts: EXIT=0` disappears and the forbidden `absurd_counts:
# EXIT=1` appears.  What that rules out is the case that would make this fixture
# worthless — three arms whose exit codes are 0 no matter what the solver did.
