# Tier-2 for fourc::input_format#17 and #19 — RESULT DESCRIPTION is
# 4C's built-in numerical self-check.
#
# Claim under test (verified by execution 2026-08-03, 4C 2026.2.0-dev):
#   (a) a RESULT DESCRIPTION entry whose VALUE matches the computed
#       answer prints 'is CORRECT' and the process exits 0;
#   (b) the same entry with a wrong VALUE prints 'is WRONG --> ...'
#       plus 'Result check failed with 1 errors out of 1 tests' and
#       the process exits 1 — so an agent can gate correctness on the
#       exit status alone;
#   (c) a TOLERANCE wide enough to swallow the error reports
#       'is CORRECT' for a badly wrong VALUE — the silent branch that
#       makes a loose tolerance worse than no check at all.
#
# The reference value 4.47909266337460053e-03 was itself obtained by
# running (c)-style with TOLERANCE 1e30 and reading abs(diff).
