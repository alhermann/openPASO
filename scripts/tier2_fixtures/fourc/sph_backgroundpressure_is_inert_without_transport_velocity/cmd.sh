# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#6 — the advice is incomplete in a way that makes
# it useless as written.
#
# Claimed:  "For free-surface problems, set BACKGROUNDPRESSURE > 0 to prevent
#           tensile instability at the free surface."
# Observed: in 4C, BACKGROUNDPRESSURE on its own does NOTHING.  It is read only
#           inside the transport-velocity branch of SPHMomentum, so unless
#           TRANSPORTVELOCITYFORMULATION is set (it defaults to
#           NoTransportVelocity, and the upstream free-surface deck leaves it
#           there) the value is never touched.  Four arms make this exact:
#
#     BASE   BACKGROUNDPRESSURE 0,     no transport velocity
#     BGP    BACKGROUNDPRESSURE 0.005, no transport velocity  -> BIT-IDENTICAL to BASE
#     TV     BACKGROUNDPRESSURE 0,     StandardTransportVelocity -> BIT-IDENTICAL to BASE
#     BOTH   BACKGROUNDPRESSURE 0.005, StandardTransportVelocity -> changes the answer
#
#   The two middle arms reproduce the deck's five result-test verdicts to the
#   last printed digit, including abs(diff) = 2.22044604925031308e-16 on density.
#   Only when both are present does anything happen.
#
# So an agent that follows the entry, sets BACKGROUNDPRESSURE > 0 on a
# free-surface deck and moves on has changed nothing at all and will believe the
# tensile instability is handled.
