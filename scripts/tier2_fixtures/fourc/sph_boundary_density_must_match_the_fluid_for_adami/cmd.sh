# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#4 — MAT_ParticleSPHBoundary's INITDENSITY has to
# match the fluid's, and getting it wrong is completely silent.
#
# The upstream 1-D hydrostatic deck runs AdamiBoundaryFormulation with both
# INITDENSITY set to 1.  Raise only the boundary material's to 100 — the fluid
# is untouched — and 4C accepts it without a word: no warning about the density
# ratio, no mention of the boundary formulation, "processor 0 finished normally"
# is still printed.  The wall pressure the Adami formulation extrapolates is
# then referenced to the wrong density, and the column settles to a different
# place: posx moves from 4.81167849295583760 to 4.70238984534387594, velx and
# density move with it, and three of the deck's five result tests fail.
#
# Both arms use the SAME kernel, the same boundary formulation and the same
# fluid material, so the only thing separating them is the density ratio.
