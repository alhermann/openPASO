# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#8 — writing boundaryphase particles does not
# give you a wall, and forgetting BOUNDARYPARTICLEFORMULATION is SILENT.
#
# Claimed: with the default NoBoundaryFormulation the boundary states are
#          allocated but never filled, the momentum equation reads them as
#          zeros, and the fluid sees a wall at zero pressure and zero velocity.
#          Nothing is printed. The MIRROR case does abort -- and what matters
#          there is the PHASE MAP, not the PARTICLES list.
#
# T2_MUTATE=1 removes the pathology: the formulation line stays in, the wall
# works, VERDICTS_WRONG goes to 0 and the fixture must go red.
