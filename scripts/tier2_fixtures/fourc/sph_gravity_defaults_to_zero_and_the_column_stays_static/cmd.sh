# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#7 — GRAVITY_ACCELERATION defaults to zero and
# nothing tells you.
#
# Delete the one line from 4C's own 1-D hydrostatic free-surface deck and the
# column does not settle by so much as a rounding error.  The probe particle
# reports its initial position back exactly:
#
#   posx    = 4.84999999999999964e+00   (it starts at 4.85)
#   velx    = 0.00000000000000000e+00   (exactly zero, not small)
#   density = 1.00000000000000000e+00   (exactly INITDENSITY, not near it)
#
# against 4.81167849295583760, -3.50289401431777894e-05 and
# 1.00015521027962739 with gravity present.  The run exits, prints no warning
# about a missing or zero body force, and the only sign anything is wrong is the
# result test — which a deck you wrote yourself would not have.
#
# That is exactly the claimed "column stays static, velocities remain ~0", made
# exact: the velocity is not approximately zero, it is bit-zero.
