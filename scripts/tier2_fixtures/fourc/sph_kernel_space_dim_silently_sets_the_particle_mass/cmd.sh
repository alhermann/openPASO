# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#0 — KERNEL_SPACE_DIM must match the physical
# dimension, and the reason is bigger than kernel normalisation.
#
# Claimed:  a dimension mismatch gives "wrong kernel normalization"; the signal
#           is hydrostatic pressure divided by the 3-D normalisation and a
#           density field "deviating ~30% from INITDENSITY at the first step".
# Observed: the mismatch is accepted in silence — no warning, no note, the run
#           completes — and the deviation is nothing like 30%: on 4C's own 1-D
#           hydrostatic deck the tested density moves from 1.00015521027962739
#           to 1.00020166835008029, i.e. the excess over INITDENSITY grows by
#           about a third while the density itself stays within 0.02% of it.  An
#           agent told to look for a 30% density error will conclude the deck is
#           fine.
#
#           The mechanism worth knowing is not normalisation: KERNEL_SPACE_DIM
#           also sets the particle VOLUME.  4C computes mass as
#           INITDENSITY * INITIALPARTICLESPACING^KERNEL_SPACE_DIM, so bumping
#           1D -> 2D on a spacing of 0.1 divides every particle's mass by ten.
