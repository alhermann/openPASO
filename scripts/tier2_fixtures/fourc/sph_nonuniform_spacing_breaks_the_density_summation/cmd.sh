# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#5 — non-uniform initial spacing corrupts the
# density field immediately, and 4C never mentions it.
#
# The claim is about zeroth-order kernel error at t = 0, so the deck is cut to a
# single step (NUMSTEP 1), the initial velocity field is dropped and the result
# block is replaced by one probe: density at an interior fluid particle,
# expected to equal INITDENSITY.  Everything else is upstream.
#
#   UNIFORM  : the 1-D lattice at INITRADIUS = 2*dx reproduces INITDENSITY to
#              abs(diff) = 1.11022302462515654e-16, i.e. exactly.  That is the
#              control: a correctly packed lattice is not approximately right,
#              it is bit-right.
#   JITTERED : shift alternate fluid particles by +-25% of dx — same particle
#              count, same total length, same mass per particle, because 4C takes
#              the mass from INITIALPARTICLESPACING and not from the actual
#              positions — and the very first density evaluation returns
#              1.16662840136084323e+00, a 16.7% error before any dynamics.
#
# So the entry's "more than 5%" is if anything conservative, and there is no
# diagnostic: no spacing check, no neighbour-count complaint, nothing.
