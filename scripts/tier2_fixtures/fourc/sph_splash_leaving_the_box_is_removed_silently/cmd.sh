# Tier-2 for fourc::particle_sph#2 — fluid that leaves DOMAINBOUNDINGBOX during
# the run is deleted, not diagnosed.
#
# Claimed:  "abort `particle outside DOMAINBOUNDINGBOX at step N`; in SPH this
#           typically triggers when a splash particle exits the bounding
#           y-extent on a dam-break case."
# Observed: no abort.  The bounding box here is left exactly as upstream wrote
#           it — the ONLY change is the direction and size of gravity, which
#           flings the free-surface column out through the far x face instead of
#           settling it — and 4C responds by quietly deleting particles as they
#           go, 48 separate times, each with the same contentless line:
#             on processor 0 removed 1 particle(s) being outside the computational domain!
#           No id, no position, no step, no phase, no abort.  The run reaches
#           the end and only then fails, with "expected 5 tests but performed 0"
#           because the result-tested particle is among the deleted.
#
# Because the geometry is untouched and the baseline reports zero removals,
# every one of those 48 deletions is mid-run by construction — which is the part
# of the claim ("throughout the simulation, including splashing and fluid
# expansion") that a startup-only check would miss.
