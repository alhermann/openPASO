# Tier-2 for fourc::linear_elasticity#4 and fourc::structural_mechanics#7
# — WHICH element type owns 2D structural cells is version-dependent in
# 4C, and the two spellings share no keywords:
#
#   4C <= 2026.2:  WALL QUAD4 <n..> MAT m KINEM k EAS e THICK t
#                       STRESS_STRAIN s GP a b
#                  (SOLID registers 3D cell types only)
#   4C >= 2026.3:  SOLID QUAD4 <n..> MAT m KINEM k
#                       THICKNESS t PLANE_ASSUMPTION p
#                  ('WALL' is then an unknown eletype)
#
# This fixture does NOT hard-code either era. It probes both spellings
# against whatever binary is installed and asserts the INVARIANT that
# holds on both: exactly ONE of the two factories accepts quad4. It
# then prints a machine-readable verdict so a reader can see which era
# the host is on.
#
# 2026-06-01: written against 4C 2026.3.0-dev, where SOLID won.
# 2026-08-03: re-run against the deployed 4C 2026.2.0-dev
#             (git 89519cf) at ${FOURC_ROOT:-$HOME/4C}/build/4C, where WALL
#             wins — the original one-sided expectation was falsified
#             on this host, which is why the fixture is now
#             era-agnostic instead of being deleted or inverted.
