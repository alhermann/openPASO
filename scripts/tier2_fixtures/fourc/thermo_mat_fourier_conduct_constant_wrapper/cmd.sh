# Tier-2: MAT_Fourier.CONDUCT requires a 'constant:' wrapper
# (list-typed), not a bare scalar.
#
# Inside MATERIALS, MAT_Fourier.CONDUCT is a tensor-valued
# property — even for isotropic conductivity the value must
# be wrapped as 'constant: [k]'. A bare scalar
# 'CONDUCT: 1.0' fails to match the MAT_Fourier input spec
# and 4C reports the whole MAT_Fourier block as 'remains
# unused'.

# verification host; the deployed build is ${FOURC_ROOT:-$HOME/4C}/build/4C.
