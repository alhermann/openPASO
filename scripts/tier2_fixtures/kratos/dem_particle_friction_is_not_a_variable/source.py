"""Tier-2: PARTICLE_FRICTION is not a Kratos variable; friction is STATIC_/DYNAMIC_.

Pitfall (kratos.dem): the openPASO DEM template used to emit PARTICLE_FRICTION into
both the mdpa Properties block and MaterialsDEM.json. The name appears in ZERO
files of the installed Kratos distribution, compiled libraries included. Kratos
DEM spells per-contact friction STATIC_FRICTION and DYNAMIC_FRICTION, and both
live in a `material_relations` entry, not in `materials`.

Observable, executed on DEMApplication 10.4.3:

  KratosGlobals.GetVariable("PARTICLE_FRICTION")
    -> ValueError: Kernel.GetVariable() ERROR: Variable PARTICLE_FRICTION is
       unknown. Maybe you need to import the application where it is defined?

  KratosGlobals.GetVariable("STATIC_FRICTION")   -> resolves
  KratosGlobals.GetVariable("DYNAMIC_FRICTION")  -> resolves

Mutation control: T2_MUTATE=1 swaps the probed name, asserting that
STATIC_FRICTION is the unknown one and PARTICLE_FRICTION the registered one --
the exact inversion of what this build provides. The registry lookup itself is
untouched, so the mutation proves the verdict comes from a real GetVariable call
and not from an echoed table. Mutated, absent_name=PARTICLE_FRICTION and both
present_name lines disappear and the process exits non-zero.
