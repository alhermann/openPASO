"""Tier-2: the stub generator this claim describes no longer exists.

Documented physics with no generator. Nothing is emitted, so
the Signal the claim gives cannot occur.

Mutation control: the pathology is a fact about the shipped catalog -- fluid_hydraulics is
documented but has no generator -- so it cannot be removed by editing a physics
row. T2_MUTATE=1 therefore changes what the fixture ASKS about: it repoints the
same two probes at linear_elasticity, which is documented AND ships
linear_elasticity_2d plus linear_elasticity_2d_nonlinear. Both probes still run
for real against backends.kratos.generators; the output becomes
in_knowledge[linear_elasticity]=True with a NON-empty generators_for list, so
in_knowledge[fluid_hydraulics]=True, generators_for[fluid_hydraulics]=[] and
stub_template_mismatches=0 all disappear and the fixture goes red.
