"""Tier-2: which Kratos knowledge catalog the backend actually consumes.

The claim is that backends.kratos.generators.KNOWLEDGE is the
ONLY per-physics catalog the backend uses, and that
data/kratos_knowledge does not export a unified
KRATOS_KNOWLEDGE dict, so importing it by that name fails
silently inside a try/except.

Mutation control: the dead `from data.kratos_knowledge import
KRATOS_KNOWLEDGE` branch this claim describes was already removed, so it
cannot be removed again. T2_MUTATE=1 REINSTATES it -- it appends that exact
import line to the backend source text the AST scan parses, i.e. it puts the
backend back into the state the claim describes. The scan is untouched and
still walks a real ast.parse of the real backend module; it must then report
backend_imports_data_kratos_knowledge=True and source_of_truth_mismatches=1.
That is what proves the printed False is a measurement of the backend's
import graph rather than a constant, and that a reintroduced dead branch is
actually caught.
