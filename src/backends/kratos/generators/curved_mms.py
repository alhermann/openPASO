"""Kratos curved-geometry MMS generators and knowledge.

Family: steady diffusion (Poisson) on a 2D annulus meshed with Gmsh,
with a smooth polar-friendly manufactured solution

    u*(r, theta) = A + B*ln(r) + C*r^m*cos(m*theta) + D*r^p

on r_inner <= r <= r_outer (r = 0 excluded, so ln(r) and r^p are smooth).
The first three terms are harmonic; only the D*r^p term sources the PDE:

    -kappa * lap(u*) = -kappa * D * p^2 * r^(p-2) =: f      (sympy-verified)

Dirichlet u = u* is imposed on both boundary circles, so the exact
solution of the BVP is u* itself and the P1 L2 error is expected to
converge at the theoretical order 2.

The generated script genuinely exercises Kratos: it builds a ModelPart
from the Gmsh mesh and solves with the ConvectionDiffusionApplication
LaplacianElement2D3N via ResidualBasedLinearStrategy.

            'NODES exactly on the circles, but element edges are straight chords, so the '
            'computed domain is a polygon inscribed in the annulus. The geometric '
            '(domain-approximation) error is O(h^2) — the same order as the P1 '
