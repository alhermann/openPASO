"""Key custody: encryption, filesystem sealing, and a public hash commitment.

Three independent controls, because each one alone has a hole the others cover.

1. **Not reachable** (primary).  ``keys/`` is ``chmod 000`` for the duration of
   a run.  This is what actually stops a runtime agent, which reads the disk as
   the same user we do.  It is a real control against an agent that wanders,
   and *not* a security boundary against one that decides to attack: the owner
   of a directory can chmod it back.  Stated plainly rather than dressed up.

2. **Not readable** (defence in depth).  Key files are AES-256-GCM encrypted
   under a passphrase that is on **no disk** while runs happen — not in a
   script, not in an env file, not in a config.  It is typed interactively at
   grading time, which is a separate, later, manual step.  So even a process
   that defeats control 1 finds ciphertext.

3. **Not changeable after the fact** (integrity).  A timestamped SHA-256
   manifest of every key file is committed to the repo *before* the campaign
   runs.  The solutions stay private; the hashes prove they were fixed in
   advance.  This answers the question a hostile reviewer will certainly ask —
   "how do we know you did not derive the solutions after seeing the results?"
   — checkably rather than on trust.

Threat model
------------
Keys are never published.  The exposure is purely local: stop a runtime agent
from reading answers off disk.  There is no published ciphertext facing offline
brute force, which is why a short passphrase is acceptable here and would not
be if the artefact were public.
