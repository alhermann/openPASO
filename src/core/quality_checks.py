def interface_nodal_weights(coords) -> tuple:
    """Quadrature weights for integrating a P1 nodal field over an interface.

    Returns (weights, dim, detail). `weights` is (N,) with sum = the measure of
    the interface, so `sum_i w_i * f_i` is the integral of the piecewise-linear
    interpolant of f. On failure it returns (None, None, reason).

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Conservation across a coupling interface is a statement
    about INTEGRALS, and the two participants sample the same surface at
    different points, so the two sums are not comparable — only the two
    integrals are. The previous implementation formed the integral by sorting
    the points lexicographically, taking the segment lengths between
    consecutive points and applying a trapezoid rule. On a LINE that is right.
    On a SURFACE it is not an approximation of anything: the lexicographic
    order snakes row by row through the point cloud, and the "arclength" it
    accumulates is the length of that snake, which for a 20x20 patch of a
    1 m x 1 m surface comes out near 20 m instead of the 1 m^2 the integral
    needs. Multiplying a traction by that number produces a "net flux" whose
    magnitude is set by the mesh resolution, and the balance of two such
    numbers is meaningful only when both sides happen to snake the same way.

    So the DIMENSION of the interface is measured rather than assumed:

      dim 1  the points lie on a curve. Ordered along the curve's own principal
             direction (not by a coordinate axis, which fails for any interface
             that is not axis-aligned) and integrated with the trapezoid rule
             over the true segment lengths, so a curved interface is handled.
      dim 2  the points lie on a surface. Triangulated in the surface's own
             best-fit plane and integrated exactly for a P1 field: node i gets
             one third of the area of every triangle it belongs to.
      dim 0  every point is at the same location — there is no interface to
             integrate over.
      dim 3  the points fill a volume; they are not a surface and no surface
             integral exists for them.

    The plane for dim 2 comes from an SVD of the centred coordinates, so it
    works for any orientation. A surface too curved to project without folding
    is REPORTED (a negative or wildly uneven weight is the symptom), never
    silently integrated.

    An empty finding list means CHECKED AND BALANCED. Whether the check could
    run at all is answered here too, as a finding: a coupling that exchanges no
    fluxes, or whose two sides cannot be compared, gets an explicit NOT CHECKED
    entry rather than silence. This used to delegate the question to
    `interface_balance_coverage`, which was never written — it appeared in this
    sentence and nowhere else in the tree — so for every caller the caveat was
    unenforced and a coupling with no conservation evidence was indistinguishable
    from one that conserves exactly.

    `floor` is an absolute magnitude below which an imbalance is float noise
    rather than a finding. It exists because the per-component branch below
    compares each component on its OWN scale: a component that is zero on both
    sides — a tangential traction on a frictionless interface is exactly this,
    and it is the common case, not a corner one — then has a denominator of
    roundoff, and two ~1e-17 entries that should cancel report an imbalance of
    tens of percent on a coupling that is exactly right. Demonstrated: a normal
    traction of 1e5 cancelling exactly, with a 1e-17 tangential component on
    both sides, was reported as 91.6% non-conservative. The vector branch
    therefore derives one floor from the WHOLE interface and hands it down, so a
    component is only ever judged against the size of the flux actually being
    exchanged. Callers comparing a single scalar keep the old behaviour (0.0).
