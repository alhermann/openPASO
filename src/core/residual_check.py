"""Discrete-residual check: does the delivered field actually solve the problem?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Attestation binds a reported number to a FILE. It never binds it to a PROBLEM.
An adversarial review demonstrated the consequence: the cheapest forgery is not
an elaborate one but a trivial one — four nodes and a constant hit any target
exactly, with no knowledge of the physics at all; and an eight-line script that
emits an analytic field plus an h-dependent perturbation is *more accurate*
than a genuine solve, 82x faster, and passes a mesh-independence study.

Nothing that inspects only the data can tell those apart, because as data they
are perfectly well-formed. The distinguishing property is not in the numbers'
appearance but in whether they SATISFY THE EQUATIONS they claim to solve.

WHAT THIS CHECKS
----------------
Given the delivered mesh and field, OASiS assembles the discrete operator of
the stated problem ON THAT MESH and measures

    rho = || A u_delivered - b ||  /  || b ||        (interior degrees of freedom)

For a genuine finite element solution rho is at the linear solver's tolerance,
because A u = b is precisely the system that was solved. For anything else it
is not:

  * the exact solution sampled at nodes does NOT satisfy the discrete system —
    it misses by the truncation error, which is orders of magnitude larger;
  * a perturbed analytic field misses by more;
  * a constant, or a field on a mesh that is not the stated domain, misses
    grossly or is refused outright by the domain check.

This is the check the attestation module's docstring names and defers. It
converts "the data looks plausible" into "the data satisfies the equations",
which is the only statement that separates solving from fabricating.

SCOPE
-----
Implemented for the operator families the evaluation uses: scalar diffusion
    -div(K grad u) = f
with constant or spatially varying scalar/tensor coefficient, on simplicial
meshes in 2D and 3D, with Dirichlet data on the outer boundary. It is not a
universal PDE checker: for an unsupported operator it returns UNSUPPORTED
rather than a false pass, so a caller can never mistake "not checked" for
"checked and fine".

# WHY THERE ARE TWO THRESHOLDS AND A BAND BETWEEN THEM
#
# A single cut-off cannot work, and measuring showed exactly how it fails. The
# residual of an analytic field sampled at the nodes falls as h^4 relative to
# the system's own scale — 6.3e-4, 4.1e-5, 2.7e-6, 1.7e-7, 1.1e-8, 6.7e-10 over
# six uniform refinements — while a genuine direct solve stays at round-off,
# about 1e-16, whatever the mesh. So a fixed 1e-8 cut-off silently starts
# CERTIFYING the forgery once the mesh is fine enough, and at the other end it
# accuses an honest run that used an iterative solver with a 1e-8 tolerance.
# Both errors are bad; the second is worse, because it condemns correct work.
#
# What actually separates the two is not a number but a scaling: a real solve
# sits at the round-off floor of this system, which depends on its size and not
# on h. So the pass threshold is that floor, and a verdict is only returned when
# the evidence supports it:
#
#   at or below the round-off floor  -> SOLVES        (only a solve gets here)
#   at or above FORGERY_RESIDUAL_MIN -> DOES NOT SOLVE(no solver leaves this)
#   in between                       -> INCONCLUSIVE  (neither credited nor
#                                                      accused)
#
# The band is where a loosely-converged honest solve and a fine-mesh forgery
# genuinely overlap. Neither is given the benefit of the doubt: the run is not
# certified as solving its equations, and it is not accused of not solving them.
# Refusing to answer when the evidence is ambiguous is the whole difference
# between a check and a guess.

# the same system, so the check is exact. Stokes is not: a genuine Stokes
# solution comes from an inf-sup-STABLE pair — Taylor-Hood P2/P1 — while a vtu
# carries nodal values, and a P1/P1 assembly is unstable. Measured: the P1/P1
# reference system is exactly singular, and a real Taylor-Hood solution sampled
# at the nodes has no reason to satisfy it. In the attempt a genuine solve came
# back INCONCLUSIVE and a divergent field u = (x, y) came back INCONCLUSIVE
# too — the check separated nothing.
#
# Reconstructing the stable system from nodal output is impossible: the P2
# edge degrees of freedom are not in the file. So Stokes needs either the
# solver's own matrix or a different family of evidence (a mesh-refinement
# study, a divergence norm, a benchmark quantity), not this one.
