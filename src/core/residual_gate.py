"""Make the discrete-residual check reachable from a run.

`core/residual_check.py` can tell a solve from a forgery — it assembles the
stated operator on the delivered mesh and measures how far the delivered field
is from satisfying it, which separates the two by many orders of magnitude. It
was unreachable: no tool took a problem statement, so nothing could ever call
it, and the verification gate's strongest check sat in the repository doing
nothing.

This module is the bridge. A run may declare the PDE it claims to solve, in the
same terms the problem statement is already given in — an operator family, a
source term, a coefficient, the domain's measure. None of that is an answer:
the source term is what the engineer is handed, not what they compute. That
distinction is the whole reason this check is admissible in a gate that must
never see an exact solution. A residual needs f, not u.

WHAT A DECLARATION LOOKS LIKE

    {"operator": "diffusion",
     "source": "2*pi**2*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)",
     "coefficient": "1.0",
     "dim": 2,
     "domain_measure": 1.0}

`source` and `coefficient` are expressions in x, y, z evaluated with numpy and
nothing else — no builtins, no imports, no attribute access. They are numeric
expressions, not a scripting surface.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO
Only the operator families residual_check implements are supported (scalar
diffusion on simplices, P1, Dirichlet data on the outer boundary). Anything else
returns UNSUPPORTED, never a pass — "not checked" must never be reachable as
"checked and fine", because a gate that silently approves what it cannot examine
is worse than one that admits the gap.
