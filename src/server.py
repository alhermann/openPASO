openPASO — MCP Server

Connects any LLM to multiple open-source FEM codes via the Model Context Protocol.
Supported backends (catalog ships 8, runtime depends on local installs):
4C Multiphysics, FEniCSx (dolfinx), deal.II, NGSolve, scikit-fem, Kratos
Multiphysics, DUNE-fem, FEBio. Call `discover(query='list')` after start-up
for the current availability and per-backend install hints.

# ── PROTECT THE PROTOCOL CHANNEL BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE IS IMPORTED ──────────
# Over stdio transport, file descriptor 1 IS the JSON-RPC stream. Libraries
# this server loads write banners to that descriptor from C code — importing
# KratosMultiphysics prints its ASCII logo — and one such banner, emitted
# while `rediscover_backends` probed installs mid-session, corrupted the
# stream ("Invalid JSON: input ' |  / ...'") and killed the client's whole
# session. Python-level capture cannot stop a C-level write, so the guard is
# at descriptor level: keep a private duplicate of the real channel for the
# protocol, and point fd 1 at stderr so anything naive lands in the log
# instead of the wire. sys.stdout (which the MCP transport writes through)
# is rebound to the duplicate, so the protocol is unaffected.

# OFA_DISABLE_PITFALLS=1 → knowledge surfaces strip pitfall-DB content
# (per-backend pitfalls incl. Signal: anchors, post-mortems, cross-backend
# collation catalog); implemented in tools/consolidated.py. It only ever makes
# openPASO weaker, so it cannot inflate a result.
#
# There was an OFA_DISABLE_CRITIC toggle here that stripped the critic
# paragraph. The critic requirement is no longer a paragraph an agent may
# choose to follow — the server holds the review record and checks it — so the
# toggle is gone along with the runtime bypass it paired with.

# The instructions text (and the critic block it leads with) live in
# core.instructions so that a harness which must put the same text in
# front of a model imports it rather than carrying a drifting copy.
