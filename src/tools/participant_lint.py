"""Name, at write time, the API calls a participant script is about to die on.

WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED. Round 49 (the first honest round on problems other than C1-C3) was lost to
wall clock, not to knowledge: every one of the nine cells hit the 45-minute limit at 35 to 73 seconds
per action, bought 37 to 75 actions, and exactly one reached couple() at all. The action sink is the
write-run-error-rewrite loop on the participant script -- and when all 58 saved step-trial fills were
re-executed and graded the way the tasks grade, 46 of them never wrote an export and EVERY ONE of those
died on an invented API call, not on the physics.

Each call below was measured on THIS install, and each finding names the error the run will print and
the call that works. The same facts are served through the coupling door; this is the moment they are
most useful, which is before the run that would have taught them.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not judge the mesh, the weak form, the material, the source or the solve --
those are the agent's and openPASO has no business dictating them. It reads the file and writes nothing.

# ── the wrong interpreter, named BEFORE the run instead of after ───────────
#
# Running a participant with an interpreter that does not have its solver is
# the largest single named failure in the recorded runs: 481 occurrences of
# `No module named '<solver>'` across 3,943 trajectory files, 284 of them
# Kratos. The run-side table answers it from the traceback. This answers it
# from the COMMAND, which is what is left when the traceback never reaches the
# reply -- `python3 participant.py > log.txt 2>&1` is the common shape, and
# then the output is empty and the failure costs another call to find.
#
# IT ASKS THE INTERPRETER, IT DOES NOT INFER. An earlier draft compared the
# command's interpreter name against the path the backend reports and flagged
# a mismatch. That is wrong twice over: a venv path ENDS WITH "python", so the
# correct interpreter looked wrong, and the default python on this host DOES
# carry one of the solvers, so a working command was flagged as broken. A gate
# that names an absent defect costs an action for nothing. So: resolve the
# interpreter the command actually names, ask it to import the module, and say
# something only when that import really fails. One probe per
# (interpreter, module), cached.

# C9/C10 work dir: 26 cells stopped with exactly ONE side exporting, and the
# silent side was side B in 16 of 17 -- DUNE 10, scikit-fem 6. Those cells were
# not out of budget when they started it: a median of 20 tool calls remained
# after the silent participant was first written, and they spent them on 265
# run_bash and 183 write_file calls between 17 cells, about 26 apiece of
# write-run-error-rewrite.
#
# What they did NOT spend them on is asking. `knowledge` was called 11 times
# across those 17 cells -- under once each -- and the decisive count is this:
# **17 of 22 never fetched the silent side's coupling contract at all** (DUNE
# 10 of 11, scikit-fem 6 of 9). The contract that exists to make that side work
# was served, and never requested.
#
# So this says so at the moment the script is written, while the 20 calls are
# still there to spend. It names an absent step and points at openPASO's own
# door; it supplies no solve, no mesh and no form.
