"""audit_results — self-consistency checks on the agent's own output files.

THE MEASURED FAILURE MODE (53 development runs with OASiS):
  * 53/53 read the knowledge; the advice channel works.
  * 51/53 execute solvers through run_bash. The verification machinery —
    residual checks in run_simulation, the critic gate, the new unsaved-work
    notice, verify_mesh_independence (used by 0/53) — hangs off tools the
    agents do not use. Every check we built sits on a road they do not drive.
  * Result: 37/54 deliver a complete answer, and most are WRONG in ways visible
    without any answer key: two runs' errors sit FLAT at ~5e-7 across all
    levels (solver tolerance floor — the task even says "converge to 1e-10"),
    one run converges at order 2 on a task that states order 3 (locking: the
    agent WROTE "mixed formulation" in its own header, built the mixed space,
    then assembled the plain form and solved that).

So the failure is not ignorance and not stubbornness: the agent reads, agrees,
writes the plan in its own comments — and nothing in the loop ever makes it
LOOK at whether what it produced matches what it planned. The critic reviews
the SETUP before the run. An independent check reviews the ANSWER after
delivery, against sealed truth. Nothing reviews the RESULT in between, and
the agent cannot see the sealed key, so it cannot check itself against truth
even if it tries.

THIS check needs no truth. It reads only what the agent itself produced —
error/QoI sequences per level — and answers three questions any numerate
reviewer would ask before delivering:
  1. Do successive levels actually approach each other? (self-convergence,
     no exact solution needed)
  2. At what observed order — and does that match the order you are about to
     CLAIM?
  3. Are the differences sitting at a floor (levels nearly identical), which
     means the thing limiting you is a tolerance, not the mesh?

It attaches to the RESULT, not to a run tool, so run_bash cannot bypass it.

    THE FILE THE AUDIT USED TO SKIP. The residual history is not a field on a

    coupling evidence that contradicts itself accounts for 69 of 250 coupled
    development runs checked (28%) — the second-largest reason after an
    outright give-up. Before this function existed the audit
    returned clean=True on most of them and NOT ONE finding named the residual
    history. (An earlier version of this note said "80 of 250" and "53 of 91";
    neither denominator is reconstructible from the tree and both are
    withdrawn in favour of the counts above, which are.) The agent was told its work was self-consistent while
    three levels carried non-finite residuals.

    Every check here is computable from the agent's own files and needs no
    reference solution: enough iterations to be an iteration, positive and
    finite, an actual decrease, and a history that is not a constant column.
    They mirror src/blind_eval/evidence.py::coupling_evidence, which is what
    an independent check applies afterwards — so a finding here is a warning
    about an outcome the agent would otherwise meet for the first time after
    delivery.

    WHY THIS IS IN THE AUDIT AND NOT ONLY IN A TOOL. The check was exposed as
    `verify_interface_flux`, described in the coupling must-read with the
    numbers from the runs it decided, and then called by ZERO of six runs in
    the next batch -- while the auto-audit on delivery reached five of those
    six. That is the same finding an earlier batch recorded for the audit
    itself: a calibrated check plus an instruction to run it was used by 1 of
    51 agents. Voluntary checking does not happen, so this one is not
    voluntary.

    What it asserts, needing no reference solution: for a flux really computed
    from your own solution, q_n(x) / (-du/dn)(x) equals k at every interface
    point, so the ratio is CONSTANT along the interface whatever k is -- and
    POSITIVE, because the task defines q_n with the OUTWARD normal.

    Measured on two real result sets, checked against an independent
    reference:
      one development run, complete but unphysical at order 1.2434 with
        BOTH prescribed codes proven to have run and the interface field
        matching to 0.000e+00: level 3 side B implied coefficient -250.8,
        against +198.1 and +200.3 at levels 1 and 2. It had the sign right on
        the coarse meshes and flipped it on the finest.
      the 4C+Kratos reference, verified correct at order 1.9796: all six sides
        positive, +0.98 to +1.30 where k = 1 and +200.4 to +206.7 where
        k = 200 -- the check recovering both conductivities from the

def export_findings(work: Path) -> list[dict]:
    """Two defects that live in the EXPORT, not the solve, and cap the outcome.

    A perfect solve reported through a broken export reads as badly as a
    wrong solve, and neither the solver log nor a refinement study can see it.
    Both of these were reproduced by execution against real result sets.

    (1) NEAREST-NODE SAMPLING INSTEAD OF INTERPOLATION. This one is real, and
        it is the largest single recoverable defect measured across the
        development runs: 99 runs with OASiS and 86 without carry the
        fingerprint. The tasks prescribe FIXED probe points that are
        deliberately not mesh nodes. Answering with the value at the closest
        node is O(h) accurate, so it caps the reported order at 1 however good
        the solve is. Measured on one 4C problem: the same solve gave order
        +1.9516 read by bilinear interpolation and +1.0179 read by nearest
        node -- and +1.0179 is exactly what the result set reported.

        The fingerprint is free: with a mesh of N cells per side, nearest-node
        sampling can only ever return (N-1)^2 + 1 distinct interior values, so
        1936 probe points collapse onto 50, 226 and 962 distinct values at
        N = 8, 16, 32. Measured on four result sets from two tasks -- all four
        show exactly 50/1936, 226/1936, 962/1936. A result set that
        interpolates shows 1908/1928/1936.

    (2) ROW ORDER IS **NOT** CHECKED, AND MUST NOT BE. It looks like a defect
        and is not one. An independent check pairs each delivered row with
        the reference EVALUATED AT THAT ROW'S OWN COORDINATES -- the shared
        field-error check does `for p, v in zip(pts, vals)` -- so a
        transposed file is read point by point exactly like an ordered one.

        Verified against an independent reference, not argued: the 4C+Kratos
        reference is correct at order 1.9796; the SAME result set with the row
        order transposed is correct at order 1.9796, bit-identical. A check on
        row order would have flagged 146 runs with OASiS and 117 without -- a
        third of the development runs -- and sent every one of them to fix
        something that costs nothing, spending the action budget that is
        already the binding constraint. It was written, measured, and removed.

# live `couple` reply (which computes the flux/continuity checks from this run's
# own exports, before any file is written) and the on-delivery audit (which
# reads the per-level files). Each check reads ONLY the agent's own output —
# its exports, its solution_/interface_/residual_level*.csv, its logs — plus
# the PUBLIC task text where one is explicitly supplied. None of it reads the
# sealed key: every path here is rooted at the agent's own work dir or at two
# strings
# the agent itself passed in. The point is corrective prominence — every finding
# NAMES THE FIX, and what_to_fix_next() surfaces the single highest-priority one
# at the top of the reply, where a weak agent that merely "acts" will read it.
