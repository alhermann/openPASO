"""An "available" backend must be the backend, not merely a file that exists.

A setup audit found `FOURC_BINARY=/bin/true` reporting
`available — 4C at /bin/true`. The check confirmed a path existed and was
executable, and nothing more.

That is the worst place in the system to be wrong. An agent calls `discover`,
is told the backend is available, and proceeds; every run then fails for a cause
the availability report has already ruled out. A stale path, a half-built tree,
or a same-named program earlier on PATH were all indistinguishable from a
working install — and the community will hit exactly those, because they are what
a machine that is not ours looks like.

The check now runs the program and looks for 4C's own vocabulary. It fails OPEN
when it cannot look (timeout, permission, OSError), because a check that cannot
run must not condemn a working install; it fails CLOSED only when the program
ran and said something that is not 4C.
