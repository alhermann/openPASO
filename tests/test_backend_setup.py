"""Tests for the guided backend-setup module + setup_backend MCP tool.

Created 2026-06-12 (task #227). Covers:
  1. Route catalog invariants — every backend has >= 1 route, every
     route covers linux, darwin entries exist as extension points
     (the user's Mac instance fills them in), pip/conda routes carry
     executable commands, source/binary routes don't pretend to.
  2. plan_setup() — structure, OS resolution, prefer= override,
     unknown-backend error.
  3. detect_backend()/setup_status() — runs against the live machine;
     asserts only stable invariants (skfem available in this venv,
     legacy config fallback resolves fourc's source tree).
  4. The legacy sources.json fallback (pre-rebrand
     ~/.config/open-fem-agent/ vs new ~/.config/openpaso/) — the
     rebrand regression found 2026-06-12.
  5. MCP tool wiring — setup_backend registered, status/usage paths.

Deliberately NOT covered here: execute_setup's real pip/conda
installs (mutates the environment; exercised manually + via the
fresh-terminal prompts in TESTING_PROMPTS.md).
