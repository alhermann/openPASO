"""Standing guards on the blind campaign's custody and blindness.

These check the campaign directory as it sits on disk, so a problem set that
drifts back into disclosing its answers, or a key that gets left in plaintext,
fails here rather than in review.

Two groups, with different preconditions:

  * custody checks run in the campaign's NORMAL state (keys sealed) and are
    always meaningful;
  * the leak-gate sweep needs to read the keys, so it is a pre-campaign audit
    step and skips when the keys are correctly sealed.
