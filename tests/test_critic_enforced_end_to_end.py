"""The critic requirement, exercised through the real MCP tools.

The unit tests in test_critic_gate.py prove the registry refuses forged, stale,
reused and mismatched tokens. They say nothing about whether openPASO ASKS it. An
audit found exactly that gap: `critic_gate` existed, was tested, and was wired
into nothing, so `run_simulation(..., critic_approved=True)` still stamped a
result VERIFIED with no critic anywhere in the process.

These tests therefore drive the tools themselves, with a real solver run, and
assert on the verdict the agent actually receives.
