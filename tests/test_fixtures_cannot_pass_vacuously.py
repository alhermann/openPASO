"""A fixture must not pass on a machine that cannot run it.

openPASO is meant to be cloned, run and picked apart by other people. That makes
"green on this workstation" worth very little on its own: what matters is
whether a stranger's run tells them the truth.

The defect this guards against was found twice. A DUNE fixture exited 0 with the
catalog tree absent. Five FEBio fixtures do this:

    fixture.json:  expect_in_output = ["degenerate_hex8="]
                   forbid_in_output = ["Traceback", "FAIL:"]
    source.py:     print("degenerate_hex8=skipped_no_binary")

With no FEBio installed, the fixture prints its key, the expectation matches,
neither forbidden string appears, and it PASSES — having verified nothing. The
same five raised the tier-2 floor from 108 to 113, so the floor now certifies
five phantom passes on any host without the binary.

Skipping when a backend is missing is correct and necessary. Reporting a PASS
for it is not. A fixture must either fail loudly or be recorded as skipped, and
the difference has to be visible in the run's own output — otherwise absence of
a backend is indistinguishable from presence of a working one, which is the same
class of silent-wrong the fixtures exist to catch.
