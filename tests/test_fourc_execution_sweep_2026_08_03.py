"""Regression: the 2026-08-03 4C execution sweep.

Every claim pinned here was produced by writing a minimal .4C.yaml,
running the deployed binary ``/home/user/4C/build/4C``
(4C 2026.2.0-dev, git 89519cf) and recording what actually happened.
The full probe log lives in the Tier-2 fixtures under
``scripts/tier2_fixtures/fourc/``:

  * ``result_description_gates_the_exit_code``
  * ``runtime_vtk_output_needs_both_sections``
  * ``thermo_prefixed_dirich_silently_ignored``
  * ``maxtime_truncates_numstep_silently``
  * ``restartevery_section_placement``
  * ``material_parameter_validation_bounds``
  * ``problem_size_is_optional_and_inert``
  * ``neumann_type_enum_vs_element_support``
  * ``structural_2d_solid_quad4_not_wall`` (rewritten era-agnostic)

This test is GEN-ONLY — it needs no 4C binary, so it runs in CI. It
guards the three things that a later edit could silently undo:

  1. the knowledge entries themselves are still present and still
     carry the executed-provenance marker, so nobody can quietly
     replace an executed claim with an inherited one;
  2. the Tier-2 fixture ``pitfall_index`` values still point at the
     pitfalls they were written for — index drift is invisible at
     review time and silently decouples a fixture from its claim
     (exactly the bug found in ``structural_dynamic_dynamictype_enum``
     on 2026-08-03, whose index 7 pointed past the end of a 7-entry
     list);
  3. the corrections this sweep made are not re-reverted: PROBLEM
     SIZE stays out of the mandatory-section list, and the
     ``result_description`` reference block keeps all 18 field-group
     names that ``valid_result_lines()`` actually registers.
