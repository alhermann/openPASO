"""Guard: openPASO's knowledge must describe the CODE, never the ANSWER.

An audit found evaluation-specific content reachable through the very tool the
server instructions tell every agent to call first. Confirmed by execution:

  * campaign identifiers inside agent-readable pitfalls — "the E5 prototype
    run (2026-08-01)", "(T14 campaign fix.)";
  * MEASURED convergence orders shipped as knowledge — "L2 EOCs
    1.984/1.996/1.999", "observed orders 1.93 / 1.99 / 1.99", "Richardson
    orders 2.018/2.004";
  * pre-solved coupled cases — an exact solution and a tuned relaxation answer
    for the same geometry the evaluation uses.

Knowledge like that makes the evaluation measure itself: the agent can read the
answer to a convergence study out of the tool being assessed.

THE RULE THIS TEST ENFORCES
    Knowledge may state how the code behaves, how it fails, what a keyword
    means in the installed version, which element locks, which default changed.
    It may NOT state the answer to a problem: a measured convergence order we
    produced, an exact solution, a tuned parameter for a specific setup, or any
    reference to our own evaluation campaign.

Published literature benchmarks WITH a citation are expertise, not answers, and
are deliberately allowed.
