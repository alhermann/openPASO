"""Regression: a size-capped knowledge payload must still be VALID JSON.

WHY this exists
===============
`prepare_simulation` renders each backend's physics knowledge into a
```json fence. Until 2026-08-03 the size cap was applied with a raw
string slice, ``text[:LIMIT]``, which cuts in the middle of whatever
value happens to sit at that byte offset.

A sweep of all (backend, physics) payloads on this install found 12 rows
over the 16000-char cap, and ALL 12 came back as INVALID JSON under the
slice — 7 SPARTA rows and 5 FEniCSx rows — failing with
"Unterminated string starting at: ..." or "Expecting property name
enclosed in double quotes: ...". An agent that receives an unparseable
payload has nothing to fall back on, and a small model will not go
hunting for a second copy: this is strictly worse than serving less.

The fix is `tools.consolidated._fit_json_block`, which shrinks by
dropping or thinning WHOLE entries instead of slicing. This test pins
its three guarantees so they cannot silently regress as knowledge grows
— and knowledge growing is exactly what triggered the bug:

  1. the rendered block always parses as JSON,
  2. no load-bearing entry is ever removed (the description, the
     runnable example, the spaces / weak form / BCs / solver blocks),
  3. anything removed is NAMED, together with the call that fetches it.

The test is deliberately written against the LIVE catalog rather than a
fixture, so a newly added physics row that blows the cap is caught here
rather than in front of an agent.
