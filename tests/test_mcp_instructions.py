"""Regression tests for the MCP `instructions` string (issue #45).

A client that truncates the server's instructions when folding them into the
model's context dropped the mid-string MANDATORY CRITIC safety block. It now
leads the string; these tests guard that it stays there, appears exactly once,
cannot be switched off, references only tools that actually exist, and tells the
agent how to SATISFY the requirement — enforcement an agent is never told about
would just make every run fail with nothing explaining why.
