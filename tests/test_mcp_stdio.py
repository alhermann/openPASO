"""
End-to-end MCP-protocol verification.

Every other test in this repo exercises the backend Python API directly
(`b.generate_input(...)`, `b.run(...)`).  That covers the implementation
the MCP server wraps, but **not** the JSON-RPC stdio layer the server
actually exposes to external agents.

This file is the missing third layer: it spawns the real MCP server as
a subprocess and drives it through `mcp.client.stdio.stdio_client`,
verifying that the tools exposed over stdio respond with well-formed
results — i.e. it would catch a regression where the server config
breaks, a tool decorator drops a parameter, or the protocol envelope
is mis-formatted, none of which the direct-API tests would notice.

The verification is intentionally minimal and behavioural:
  - `list_tools` returns the expected set of tool names
  - `discover()` returns *something* non-empty
  - `prepare_simulation('skfem', 'poisson')` returns a payload that
    contains a `template` and a `knowledge` section
  - one full `run_simulation` round-trip for skfem-Poisson returns a
    completed job with a non-empty `output_files` listing

Anything beyond those four checks belongs in a per-tool test rather
than a smoke probe.
