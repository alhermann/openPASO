"""Regression: every audit-driven physics added via the upstream-
demo audit loop must be fully visible through the MCP tool surface
(discover + knowledge + prepare_simulation + examples).

Context: when adding a new physics, six things need to line up:
  1. PhysicsCapability registered in backend.py supported_physics()
  2. Generator wired in generators/__init__.py
  3. KNOWLEDGE entry merged into the registry dict
  4. Tier-0/Tier-1 pitfall verification (real symbols, observable
     vocab) — verified by scripts/verify_signal_clauses.py
  5. Layer-F end-to-end execution gate — verified by
     scripts/tier2_fixtures/cross_backend/catalog_template_executes
  6. END-USER MCP-TOOL VISIBILITY — discover, knowledge,
     prepare_simulation, examples all return the new physics
     and its content, not "not found"

This gate covers (6). The other layers cover (1)-(5).

Concretely, an LLM client trying to use a newly-added physics
hits these four MCP tools in sequence; if any returns a
generic "no such physics" or an empty knowledge dict, the
practical UX is broken even though the in-code catalog is fine.

The test is intentionally NOT generic — it pins down the
exact set of audit-driven physics from the 2026-06-02 sweep.
When new audit-driven physics ship, EXTEND `_AUDIT_DRIVEN_PHYSICS`
in lock-step. The test failing on a new addition means the
new physics is in-code-canonical but MCP-tool-invisible: probably
a wiring miss in backend.py or the generator __init__.
