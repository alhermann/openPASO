"""Every input key openPASO names must exist in the backend that would consume it.

A wrong warning misleads a user. A wrong KEY produces a deck the solver refuses
to parse, for every user, every time — and the user has no way to tell whether
the key is wrong or their problem is. Two of these were live in the corpus when
this gate was written:

  * `SOUNDSPEED` and `SMOOTHING_LENGTH`, served as required 4C SPH material
    parameters beside `DYN_VISCOSITY` and the real `BULK_MODULUS`, one of them
    carrying the numeric tuning rule "c >= 10 * v_max". Neither appears in any
    file of 4C's source or in any of its 2171 input decks — and neither does
    `DYN_VISCOSITY`, which this docstring called real until 2026-08-09. 4C's
    MAT_ParticleSPHFluid spells it `DYNAMIC_VISCOSITY` (`4C -p`). Three
    fabrications in one sentence, two of them named as the honest company the
    third kept.
  * `AREA0`, in the arterial-network DECK TEMPLATE — the YAML actually written
    into the input file. 4C's `MAT_CNST_ART` has no such parameter; the
    reference geometry comes from `DIAM`. The same generator already carried a
    warning saying exactly that, and the template was never updated.

WHY THIS IS A BASELINE AND NOT A HARD FAIL
------------------------------------------
The corpus has candidates under active triage, and a hard fail would block every
unrelated change until the last one is resolved. So the gate ratchets: it fails
on any key NOT in the recorded baseline, which catches a newly invented key the
moment it is written, while the known set is worked down.

The baseline is deliberately a readable JSON file listing every key by name, not
a count and not a hash. An allowlist you cannot read is a place for things to
hide. It is expected to shrink to empty; entries leave it as they are fixed or
reclassified as correct negatives.

WHAT THIS GATE REFUSES TO ASSERT
--------------------------------
It renders no verdict at all for a backend whose corpus it cannot see. Kratos
does not import on this host, and only 3 of its ~40 applications are installed,
so a key from the DEM or Poromechanics application is invisible here no matter
how real it is — reported UNVERIFIABLE, never "invented". An audit that judged
Kratos against scipy once reported 121 of 139 keys as fabricated; every one was
an artefact of not being able to see the software.
