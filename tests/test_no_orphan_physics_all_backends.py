"""Cross-backend regression: every deep_knowledge physics key is exposed.

Closes the orphan-knowledge gap discovered iteratively
2026-06-01. For every backend that has a data/*_knowledge.py
catalog OR a deep_knowledge dict, every key carrying a
'pitfalls' list must be reachable via
backend.supported_physics() — otherwise the catalog text is
unreachable from discover.

This test was extracted from test_no_fenics_orphan_physics.py
once the same gap was found in fourc (4 umbrella orphans:
particles, scalar_transport, structural_mechanics, thermal).

Reference-only catalogs (element_catalog, mesh_catalog, etc.)
are intentionally NOT physics and are excluded.
