"""A template must not claim to be a backend it does not use.

openPASO is going to be read and picked apart by the computational-mechanics
community. The single most damaging thing it could contain is a template that
names a solver and quietly solves with something else — a reviewer who finds one
is entitled to distrust everything around it.

There were real instances. DUNE's `linear_elasticity_2d` was literally
`return _poisson_2d(params)` and printed "DUNE-fem Poisson solve complete."
under an elasticity name; its `stokes_2d` was a self-described Poisson "proxy".
Both were repaired on their branch. This guard is what stops the next one.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT A SURROGATE, because the distinction decides whether a thing
is dishonest or merely limited:

  * A template that solves the physics with a DIFFERENT library, while SAYING SO
    in its docstring, is legitimate. Eight Kratos templates assemble with
    numpy/scipy and seven of them say "Kratos (manual assembly)" or
    "(standalone)" on the first line; the server instructions route them to
    `run_simulation` accordingly. The physics is right and the reader is told.
  * The same template with an unqualified "— Kratos Multiphysics" docstring is
    NOT legitimate, and exactly one was in that state. A weak model reads the
    first line and stops; telling it "Kratos Multiphysics" when the code is
    scipy is the opposite of the truth.
  * A reference stub that says "Not a runnable input — the user must supply the
    case-specific mesh" and lists the requirements is legitimate. Twenty 4C
    entries are of that kind. Declining to fabricate a mesh you cannot know is
    honesty, not a gap.

So the rule enforced here is narrow and defensible: if a template does not use
its own backend, its docstring must say so.
