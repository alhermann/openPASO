"""Guards for the install / setup / build-configuration surface.

WHAT THIS PROTECTS
    `src/backends/_setup.py` is the first thing a new user needs and the last
    thing anyone re-checks. It is also the surface most exposed to drift,
    because it describes the machine it was written on: an install route stays
    in the file long after the package it names has moved, and a claim keeps
    its confident tone long after the build option it depended on changed.

    So the tests here enforce SHAPE rather than content, with one exception.
    The exception is the important one:

        A claim that depends on build configuration MUST tell the reader how
        to find out which configuration they have.

    That is the whole point of the surface. "deal.II raises ExcDivideByZero on
    CG breakdown" is a true sentence and a useless one, because it is true on
    a Debug build and impossible on a Release build, and the reader has no
    idea which they are running. The fix is not to delete the claim — it is to
    ship the check alongside it. `test_build_config_claims_carry_a_check`
    makes that mechanical instead of aspirational.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
    It does not assert that any measured quantity has a particular value, and
    it does not re-verify the quoted error strings by running solvers. A test
    that shells out to nine backends would be skipped on almost every machine
    that runs the suite, and a skipped test guards nothing. The strings were
    verified by execution when they were written; what a merge gate can
    usefully add is that nobody adds an entry in the WRONG SHAPE afterwards.

    Where a test does touch a real install, it SKIPS when the install is
    absent rather than passing — same rule as
    tests/test_fixtures_cannot_pass_vacuously.py. A pass on a machine that
    could not run the check is worse than no test, because it is indistinguish-
    able from a pass on a machine that could.
