"""A shared helper must survive being copied into the mutation scratch tree.

WHY, and this has now bitten three times
----------------------------------------
The mutation harness copies a fixture into a temporary directory and runs it
there, so a fixture that reaches outside its own directory only works if the
harness brings that thing along. It stages siblings whose name begins with `_`:

    scripts/mutate_tier2_fixtures.py:83
        if sib.is_dir() and sib.name.startswith("_"):

**Directories only.** A shared helper written as a bare `_helper.py` is never
copied, the staged fixture cannot import it, and the run dies before the
mutation is even applied. The harness then reports VACUOUS_BASELINE — "I could
not evaluate this" — which is easy to skim past as "not red".

That is the whole danger. The mutation verdict is the ONLY evidence that a
fixture detects its pathology rather than passing for some unrelated reason, so
a harness that cannot evaluate is indistinguishable from a fixture that has no
evidence, and both look calm in a summary.

Three separate instances, all found by execution rather than review:

  * 4C — 174 fixtures sourced `../_lib/preamble.sh`, which the harness did not
    stage at all. Sampled 12 and 9 were vacuous: the UNMUTATED copy already
    failed, so every mutation "KILLED" for the wrong reason. Fixed by staging
    the parent layout, plus a baseline precheck that emits VACUOUS_BASELINE
    instead of a verdict.
  * coupling — the flagship's 18 fixtures shared a bare `_couplinglib.py`. All
    18 would have been vacuous. Fixed by making it `_lib/`.
  * febio (70 fixtures) and sparta (27) still share `_febio_lib.py` and
    `_spahelp.py` as bare files. 97 fixtures whose mutation evidence would mean
    nothing.

The fix is trivial — make the helper a package directory — which is exactly why
it should be enforced rather than remembered.

    """The fourth instance of the same failure class, and its fix.

    A fixture that audits the CATALOG rather than a solver has to find the
    checkout. In place it walks up from `__file__`; staged into the scratch
    tree there is no such ancestor, so it aborts with
    FIXTURE_ABORT=no_openpaso_checkout and the harness scores VACUOUS_BASELINE —
    "this verdict would mean nothing" — on every run.

    Measured: 7 of the 11 Kratos fixtures that ship a `_mutation` block sat in
    that state, so the ledger carried no machine discrimination evidence for
    any of them, even though each had been proved KILLED by hand with
    OPENPASO_REPO exported on the command line. With the runner exporting it,
    all 11 are KILLED and 0 are vacuous.

    The runner knows where the checkout is and the staged fixture cannot, so
    saying it is the runner's job. Asserted on the environment the runner
    builds, not on a source grep.
