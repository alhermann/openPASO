"""The Signal gate must not declare a foreign library's diagnostics real.

`verify_signal_clauses.py` tier 0 checks that a Signal names a "real" entity,
where real means "present in a hand-maintained per-backend allowlist". That
makes the gate circular: a Signal cites a name, the name gets added so the gate
goes green, and the entry then validates the Signal. Nothing ever consults the
software.

Measured consequences, both found by adversarial audit rather than by the gate:

  * FEBio's allowlist declared `NOX`, `DIVERGED_LINE_SEARCH` and
    `DIVERGED_FNORM_NAN` real, annotated as "tokens that real FEBio logs emit".
    They are Trilinos and PETSc names. FEBio links NEITHER — confirmed against
    febio4 and all twelve of its shared libraries. An audit found 25 fabricated
    FEBio Signals; this entry is why they passed tier 0.
  * NGSolve's allowlist declared `KSPSolve`, `DIVERGED_BREAKDOWN` and
    `DIVERGED_INDEFINITE_PC` real, annotated as tokens "NGSolve also surfaces
    via krylovspace bindings". Its shared library contains no PETSc KSP strings
    at all.

A pitfall whose Signal cannot occur is worse than no pitfall: it tells an agent
that never seeing a message it could never have seen means the problem is
absent. So this guard refuses the specific move that produced both — allowlisting
another project's diagnostic vocabulary for a backend that does not link it.

It is deliberately narrow. It does not try to verify the whole allowlist against
every install, because most entries are ordinary API names and the corpora are
not always available. `scripts/verify_signal_literals.py` does that check where a
binary can be inspected. What this stops is the one pattern that has actually
caused fabrications twice.

# A first version of this guard hard-coded the answer. That reproduces the exact
# defect it was written to catch: a hand-maintained table asserting what is real,
# never checked against the software. A peer audit made the point concrete by
# reporting that DUNE genuinely links PETSc on this box — which, if a DUNE Signal
# ever quoted a PETSc diagnostic, this guard would have called a fabrication.
#
# So the table below is only consulted when the installed artefacts cannot be
# inspected. Where they can, the evidence decides. `_evidence_links()` looks for
# the library's own marker strings in what the backend actually loads.
#
# On the DUNE claim specifically: `libpetsc_real.so.3.12` exists system-wide but
# NOT inside `dune-fem-env`, and the peer's `ldd` evidence could not be
# reproduced here. So DUNE is deliberately absent from the table — an unconfirmed
# peer assertion is not evidence, and the evidence path will admit it
# automatically if the linkage is real.
