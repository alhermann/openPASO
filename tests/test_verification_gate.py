"""Tests for the verification-gate verdict (_stamp_verification).

openPASO enforces verification IN SOFTWARE: it verifies via numerical checks on the
RUN (completed, produced output, finite / converged / balanced) but does not
validate. It does NOT currently bind a reported NUMBER to that run — an audit
showed an invented value attached to a real run still passes — so these tests
pin what the gate actually does, not what it was once described as doing.

The independent pre-execution critic is MANDATORY and UNCONDITIONAL: a result is
trustworthy ONLY when it passes the numerical checks AND a critic review of that
exact setup is on the server's record. `critic_approved=True` is a self-report
and verifies nothing by itself; there is no environment switch that lifts the
requirement. Enforced by verdict, never by error. These tests pin exactly that,
plus the anti-fabrication labelling.
