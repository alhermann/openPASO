"""Find and end every process a run started.

Stopping a run used to cancel the coroutine that was waiting on the work, and
nothing else. `run_bash` waits on its command in a worker thread, so the command
and every solver it launched kept running; a solver started through openPASO's
own tools lives under the openPASO server process, which was left alone too. The
screen said "You stopped this run" while the computation carried on.

A run's processes are recognised by what they share, read from /proc so no
extra dependency is needed:

* the openPASO server for the run, and everything it starts, carry
  ``OPENPASO_CELL_WORKDIR=<the run's work directory>`` in their environment;
* shell commands the agent runs start inside the run's work directory;
* Claude Code is launched with the same environment marker.

Everything below a matching process is included, because a child that changed
directory or dropped the variable is still that run's work.
