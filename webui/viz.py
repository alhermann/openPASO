"""What a file a run wrote is, in a form the interface can show.

One payload per kind, and each says only what this module actually read:
a table of the first rows for CSV and TSV, the parsed object for small
JSON, the description at the head of a field series with the URL of the
file itself, the XML and the data files it names for XDMF, the top-level
contents for HDF5, text for anything textual, and for a mesh or result
file (VTK and friends) a descriptor with its format and URL — the
interface says plainly that it cannot draw those and offers the download.

Nothing here parses a mesh, and nothing here builds a figure.
